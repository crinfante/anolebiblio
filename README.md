# Anolis literature collection
This respository hosts an ever improving bibliography of literature relating to _Anolis_ lizards. If you have citations to add we encourage these be submitted as a pull request.

The collection is saved as a [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org) file, a format used by the Latex markup language. Free software [Bibdesk - mac](www.bibdesk.org) | [JabRef - all](http://www.jabref.org/) | [BibTool - all](http://www.gerd-neugebauer.de/software/TeX/BibTool/en/) can be used to interact with these files, and most major citation software packages (e.g. Endnote, Papers, Mendely, Zotero) can import BibTeX files.
