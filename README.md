# Anolis literature collection
This respository hosts an ever improving bibliography of literature relating to _Anolis_ lizards. This file in then used to create the [Anole Literature](crescatscientia.com/anolis-literature/) page on [Anole Annals](www.anoleannals.org). If you have citations to add, we encourage these be submitted as a pull request.

The collection is saved as a [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org) file, a format used by the Latex markup language.
