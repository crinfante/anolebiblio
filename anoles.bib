@article{Logan:1981aa,
	Abstract = {Melanotrophin-potentiating factor (MPF) is a fragment of human beta-lipotrophin (LPH 88-91) which potentiates the action of alpha-MSH on Anolis skin. In the present study, we investigated the effect of MPF on MSH-induced melanogenesis. Pooled hair follicle scrapings from Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) were incubated for 48 hours with or without alpha-MSH and/or MPF. Melanogenesis was monitored by measuring tyrosinase activity and melanin accumulation. 10-8 M MPF potentiated the effect of no effect on melanogenesis, but 10-9 to 10-7 M alpha-MSH caused a dose-related increase. 10-8 M MPF potentiated the effect of each dose of alpha-MSH. Thus MPF potentiated MSH action on mammalian melanogenesis as well as on reptilian melanosome dispersion. Although each of these processes involve different intracellular responses the receptor mechanisms involved in each may therefore be the same.},

@article{Laughran:1981aa,
	Abstract = {Two types of filaments (microfilaments 4--6 nm in diameter, and intermediate filaments 7--10 nm in diameter) are common in the surface epithelial cells and theca fibroblasts of vitellogenic ovarian follicles of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. Heavy meromyosin (HMM), which forms complexes with actin filaments, interacts only with the microfilaments of theca fibroblasts. After myosin extraction of follicles no filaments disappeared, but when this treatment was followed by incubation with deoxyribonuclease I (DNA-ase I), which depolymerizes F-actin to G-actin, microfilaments disappeared from the theca fibroblasts. It is concluded that microfilaments in theca fibroblasts are actin-like and may contract to provide the mechanism of expulsion for the oocyte during ovulation. The intermediate filaments of the surface epithelial cells and theca fibroblasts may serve as a skeletal system for the large (up to 8 mm in diameter) vitellogenic follicle.},

@article{Larsson:1981aa,
	Abstract = {The distribution of the tracer substance horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Mw 40,000) in the neuro-intermediate lobe of the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, was studied at various time intervals (13 min to 24 h) after vascular injection. HRP rapidly entered the extracellular lumen of the neural lobe, but did not penetrate into the third ventricle. The tracer was found in micropinocytotic vesicles (MPVs) of ependymal cells within 13 min after injection. The number of cellular inclusions containing HRP increased during the period of observation (24h). The tracer was sparsely taken up by aminergic and peptidergic nerve terminals of the external layer. After transection of the hypophysial stalk, numerous dense, labelled droplets were found in the peptidergic terminals, and the number of labelled inclusions in ependymal cells increased. MPVs were frequently found in extensions of stellate cells of the intermediate lobe, and endocytotic vacuoles (EVs) developed especially in the perikaryon. HRP was also found in large cisternae of the secretory cells, appearing predominantly towards the perivascular septum (PVS). These cisternae were found to communicate with the extracellular lumen, probably representing a system of the extracellular space extending into the secretory cell. After transection of the hypophysial stalk, there was an increase in the number of small EVs in secretory cells of the intermediate lobe. The results are discussed in terms of MSH-release regulation and possible participation of the extracellular lumen, glial and stellate cells in the transport of regulating factors and secretory material.},

@article{Cashner:1981aa,
	Abstract = {In June, 36 lizards (males and females) were injected with 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, or 100 mg/kg of MIF-I, or the diluent vehicle, and placed in a cage for ten minutes. Tonic immobility (TI) was then induced on an open lab table. All doses of MIF-I significantly reduced TI duration as compared to the duration with the diluent alone. In subsequent experiments lizards were injected with 0.1 mg/kg of MIF-I, 0.1 mg/kg of naloxone, or the diluent vehicle, and placed in small aquaria for ten minutes. TI was then induced in the small aquaria. In July, using 60 females, MIF-I and naloxone slightly reduced the duration of TI, but not significantly, and overall TI durations were reduced as compared with the first experiment possibly because the lizards could escape from the view of the experimenter in the corners of the aquaria. A third experiment was done in late September and early October with 120 males and 120 females. No drug effect was seen, but there was a significant difference between the TI durations of males and females, the females having longer durations. A relationship between the difference in response to MIF-I and the breeding seasons of the lizards could not be determined due to the possibility that the change in experimental design after the June experiments may alone have accounted for the loss of the significant response to MIF-I.},

	Abstract = {The electron microscopic localization of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) in the pancreas of the iguanid lizard, Anolis carolinensis was studied by the unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunocytochemical technique. Insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin were localized absolutely to those cells previously identified on the basis of the characteristics of their secretory granules as being beta cells, alpha cells, and D cells, respectively. The secretory granule cores of the PP-containing cells appeared to be ellipsoidal with a semi-major axis of 450 nm and a semi-minor axis of 365 nm. This previously unidentified cell type is named the F cell, in keeping with the localization of PP to the original F cell of the canine pancreas. Without immunocytochemical staining, the qualitative ultrastructural characteristics of the F cell secretory granules were inadequate to permit identification of the F cell, especially with regard to the D cell.},

The dimensions of the junctions, as characterized by the distance between opposite extremities of the arciform membrane appositions, averaged 0.14, 0.19, and 0.28 microgram, respectively, on noncalyceal utricular and saccular hair cells, and calyceal cells of the utricular striola.

	Abstract = {Both luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) induce sexual receptivity in ovariectomized, estrogen-primed female lizards (Anolis carolinensis). Ovariectomized females pretreated with three daily injections of a subthreshold dose (0.2 micrograms) of estradiol benzoate were administered either 500, 1,000 or 1,500 ng of LHRH, or 1,000 ng of TRH 48 h following the last estrogen pretreatment injection. Hormone-treated females exhibited significantly higher sexual receptivity scores than controls when tested 2, 4, 6 and 24 h post-injection. Female sexual receptivity scores in females that were administered 500 ng of LHRH or 1,000 ng of deamido TRH were, however, no different than control scores at these test times. The observed ability of LHRH to increase female sexual receptivity is consistent with previous results in birds and mammals. The ability of TRH to increase female sexual receptivity is a novel finding that may underscore differences in neuroendocrine regulation of vertebrate estrous behavior.},

	Abstract = {Immunocharacteristics of the pars distalis cells of the pituitary of the male lizard A. carolinensis are determined by employing the immunoperoxidase technique with antisera to mammalian pituitary hormones. On the basis of their immunoreactivity, 5 different cell types with characteristic anatomical distribution are recognized. ACTH cells are found in the rostral half of the pars distalis, and PRL cells in the rostral two thirds of the pars distalis. GH and TSH cells are located in the caudal half of the pars distalis. GTH cells are distributed throughout the gland. When consecutive sections are stained with antiserum to ovine FSH or its beta-subunit and to ovine LH, the same cells show immunoreactivity to all the three antisera. None of the GTH cells show positive immunoreactivity to ovine beta-LH antiserum. The results suggest the existence of one gonadotropic cell type in the pituitary of this lizard.},

	Abstract = {The presence and the neuroanatomical topography of sex hormone concentrating cells in the brain of the American chameleon, Anolis carolinensis have been demonstrated by these experiments. After 3H-estradiol administration large numbers of hormone concentrating cells were found in the amygdala, septum, medial preoptic area, anterior hypothalamic area, the ventromedial and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, and anterior pituitary. In addition, labelled cells were found in the torus semicircularis, in and around the nucleus isthmus pars parvocellularis. A small number of labelled cells could also be found in the rostral pallium, motor nucleus of the fifth cranial nerve, the raphe nuclei, and the spinal cord. After 3H-testosterone or 3H-dihydrotestosterone administration the neuroanatomical pattern was very similar to that found after 3H-estradiol; however, fewer labelled cells were seen after the androgens were given. Two exceptions to the similarity of pattern were in a caudal part of the pallium and in the mesencephalic tegmental area. Hormone-concentrating cells were found after 3H-testosterone or 3H-dihydrotestosterone administration, while labelled cells in these two areas after 3H-estradiol administration were extremely rare. The pattern of hormone-concentrating cells was the same in male and female brains, for each of the hormones. The preoptic area, hypothalamus, and anterior pituitary have been demonstrated in reptiles to be involved in neuroendocrine regulation and in the control of sex behaviors. The presence and neuroanatomical pattern of sex steroid binding cells in the brains of a wide variety of vertebrates have been documented. Large numbers of hormone-concentrating cells were found in all of these species in the medial preoptic area, tuberal hypothalamus, specific limbic structures, the mesencephalon deep to the tectum, and the anterior pituitary. Most hormone-concentrating cells in the brain of A. carolinensis were found in these same brain regions, thus indicating a vertebrate-wide stable core of hormone-concentrating cells in neuroanatomically defined regions.},

Responses to a conspecific male antagonist in a territorial confrontation were then tested when the subject's vision was limited to an eye leading to either the normal or lesioned hemisphere. In lizards with lesions involving the paleostriatum and lateral forebrain bundle, there was an elimination of or marked deficit in the performance of the challenge display while signature displays and measures of general activity were not significantly affected. Lesions predominantly in anterior or posterior dorsal ventricular ridge resulted in no significant deficit in any behavioral measure.},

Two types of synaptic endings are endings are present on motor neurons. The first type is characterized by distinct synaptic clefts measuring 15-20 nm between pre- and postsynaptic membranes, and by clear presynaptic vesicles. The second type of synapse, which is less common, is characterized by gap junctions between pre- and postsynaptic membranes. At these synapses, there are also clusters of clear vesicles close to the presynaptic membrane adjacent to the gap junction.

@article{Shivers:1979aa,
	Abstract = {The anatomical basis of the blood-brain barrier in the American chameleon, Anolis carolinensis, is the system of tight intercellular junctions that occurs between apposed endothelial cells of brain capillaries. Under normal physiological conditions, capillaries in the brain cortex of these animals remain sealed by interendothelial zonulae occludentes and, consequently, escape of exogenous tracer proteins such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the extracellular compartment of the central nervous system is prevented. Systemic injection of 2.7 mg of D-glucose into chameleons results in increased brain capillary permeability, as evidenced by escape of HRP or Trypan blue into the intercellular spaces of central neuropil. Freeze-fracture analysis of brain capillary endothelia of glucose-hyperglycemic lizards revealed no alteration of the ridge and groove construction of endothelial tight junctions, indicating that although the blood-brain interface becomes leaky during severe hyperglycemia, the capillary zonulae occludentes are not affected. Evidence obtained in this study strongly supports the notion that the increased capillary permeability is the result of amplified transendothelial transport. The effect is manifest as and facilitated by the formation of chains of pinocytotic vesicles derived from the luminal surface of the endothelial cells, which fuse to create open trans-endothelial conduits. It is likely that formation of open channels that traverse brain capillary endothelial cells, as a response to hyperglycemia, could allow temporarily unrestricted passage of a wide range of molecules, some potentially toxic, into the CNS extracellular milieu. This is the first report to unequivocally document with freeze-cleave techniques, that abnormally elevated levels of blood sugar can affect blood-brain interface permeability. This finding suggests that similar consequences may be expected to result from diabetic hyperglycemia in humans.},

	Abstract = {An electron microscopic examination of the parietal retinas of Anolis carolinensis and Iguana iguana demonstrated within each retina (1) two distinct populations of neurons, (2) two populations of glia, and (3) a population of photoreceptors which could not be subdivided. A small population of very electron-dense cells, in many respects similar to photoreceptors, was also found in the iguana. Correspondingly dark processes were found in the plexiform layer of each retina. Parietal photoreceptors generally resemble cones of the lateral eye. Glial cells were sub-classified on the basis of the location of their somata and the disposition of their processes. Neurons were identified by virtue of their cytology and their reception of axosomatic ribbon synapses from unidentified plexiform layer processes. Neuronal subtypes were located on opposite sides of the plexiform layer. Neurons distal to that layer were found to project the initial segments of their processes into the plexiform layer parallel to its long axis, while neurons central to the plexiform layer projected axons centrally and dendrites radially into the plexiform layer. The existence of at least two neuronal populations and of interphotoreceptor synapses suggests that photosensory processing within the parietal retina may be more complex than previously assumed.},

	Abstract = {Morphological changes in the disconnected neuro-intermediate lobe were studied in the lizard, Anolis carolinensis from the 2nd to the 14th post-operative day using a threefold aldehyde fixative (Rodriguez, 1969). Two phases of colour change capacity were exhibited: Phase I started immediately after the transection, lasted for 6 days (mean) and was characterised by an excessive MSH release (brown skin). This phase proceeded gradually into Phase II, designated by an interruption by the MSH release (green skin). The degenerative processes and final elimination of neurons in the disconnected neural lobe propagate in a rostro-caudal direction from the transected area. The aminergic fibres (Type II) disappear within 2 days postoperatively, whereas the degeneration continues for more than 10 days in the peptidergic fibres (Type III, IV and V). The glia cells (ependyma and pituicytes) serve as very active macrophages, engulfing fragments of axons already affected by autolysis and transferring them into glial lysosomes. No apparent morphological changes occur in the shift from Phase I to II. The great majority of the secretory cells of the intermediate lobe are not affected by degenerative processes and appear to be markedly activated by the stalk transection. They exhibit numerous mitochondria, well-developed Golgi complexes forming numerous Golgi vesicles and extensive parallel cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, sometimes forming large intracisternal droplets (7 micron in diameter). Numerous pale vacuoles are seen, especially toward the intact capillaries, suggesting their coupling to the MSH release by extension of the active membrane area toward the perivascular septum. The number of these vacuoles is very markedly reduced in Phase II (no release), whereas the formation of new granules seems to proceed in early stages. The interruption of the MSH release implies a successive refilling of gradually growing secretory granules and a concomitant reduction in the development of the synthetic apparatus. Mechanisms probably involved in the control of the synthesis and release of MSH are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The ultrastructure of the intermediate lobe of the hypophysis was studied in Anolis carolinensis with the use of a threefold aldehyde fixative. Lizards with a brown skin were selected. The possibility of two types of secretory cells is discussed; neither cell type is innervated. Type I cells are rarely found and contain dense granules approximately 0.3 micron in diameter; Type II cells vary widely in secretory activity. Most of the Type II cells contain a large number of dense secretory granules (up to about 1.3 micron in diameter) almost filling the cytoplasm. Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi apparatus and mitochondria are poorly developed. Only some of these cells show signs suggesting a high secretory activity, namely a well developed RER, Golgi apparatus and numerous mitochondria. In these cells the RER sometimes forms large intracisternal droplets (up to 7 micron in diameter). Two of the animals exhibited a more uniform, high secretory activity. Large (about 2 micron in diameter), pale vacuoles, probably of extracellular character, were found mostly in the vicinity of the perivascular septum. Their role in the release of MSH is discussed. The present data, which are discussed with reference to earlier findings (Forbes, 1972), form the morphological basis for an experimental study on regulation of MSH release (Larsson et al., 1979).},

	Abstract = {The junctional complexes of the myelin sheath of central nervous system axons in the American chameleon, Anolis carolinensis, exhibit an intramembrane ridge and groove construction in freeze-fracture replicas that has usually been interpreted in other organisms as evidence for an occluding or tight intercellular junction. Close examination of PF fracture face ridges, however, shows them to be made up of discontinuous rows of particles of variable length separated by frequent gaps of non-uniform width. Introduction of horseradish peroxidase into the intercellular milieu of the lizard central nervous system is followed by appearance of this protein in interlamellar spaces of the myelin sheath and in the intercellular spaces containing focal membrane fusions that correspond precisely in position and center-to-center spacing to the ridges and grooves in platinum replicas of the same tissue. Since the junctional ridges on PF fracture faces in these mesaxonal junctional complexes are conspicuously discontinuous and since the areas within the myelin sheath where these junctional complexes are located inner and outer mesaxons) are readily permeated by exogenous protein tracer, it is concluded that the junctional complexes of central myelin mesaxons, heretofore incorrectly interpreted as functionally tight, are actually very leaky and probably contribute only to the structural stability of the myelin sheath architecture.},

	Abstract = {The androgen aromatization hypothesis was examined in the male lizard, Anolis carolinensis. After castration, sc silastic implants of testosterone (T) restored both challenge and courtship behavior, while dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or 17beta-estradiol (E) had no effect on male behaviors. Both T and DHT, but not E, stimulated hypertrophy and colloid production by the renal sex segment, a secondary sexual characteristic of male lizards. In two separate studies, castrates received DHT in combination with E. In each replicate, half of the castrates responded with increases in courtship behavior after hormone treatment. Epithelial cell height of the sex segment of all DHT and E-treated castrates was comparable to T- or DHT-treated castrates, but colloid production was not stimulated. These experiments indicate that in this species, treatment with T stimulates both sexual behavior and secondary sex character development, whereas treatment with E alone is without effect centrally or peripherally.},

	Abstract = {An accurate, highly reproducible and sensitive bioassay for melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) using the skin of Anolis carolinensis in vitro is described. The time taken for green Anolis skin fragments to change to a specific, visually assessed, green-brown color is dose-related, and this forms the basis of the new assay. The method is simple to perform, and 1 person may assay 20 samples in a day using the dorsal skin from a single adult lizard. The mean dose-response ranges between 48 X 10(-12) and 375 X 12(-12) M (38 to 625 pg/ml). Using the assay, alpha-MSH, beta-MSH, ACTH (4-10), and ACTH (1-10) were equipotent on a molar basis. For repeated bioassay of rat pituitary extracts, the dose-response curves were highly significant, and only 1 of the 9 pituitary dose-response curves deviated significantly from the slope of the standard alpha-MSH curve. The index of precision, lambda, for the 9 pituitary bioassays ranged between 0.037 and 0.081, while the mean 95% fiducial limits were -6.6 and 7.1% on either side of the estimated potency. The new rate method is compared with an earlier quantal method which also uses the isolated skin of Anolis carolinensis. The quantal method does not have dose-response characteristics and is therefore less accurate and reproducible than the new method; the coefficient of variation for repeated bioassay of the same pituitary extracts ranged from between 12 to 20% for the quantal method and between 2.9 to 5.7% for the new rate method.},

	Abstract = {Scanning and transmission electron microscopy have been used to investigate the structure of the papilla neglecta in the lizard, Anolis carolinensis. Situated in the posterior part of the utricle, the receptor is innervated by a branch of the posterior ampullary nerve and is covered by an extracellular membrane that exhibits a tapering extension into the orifice of the utriculo-saccular duct. The neuroepithelium contains two populations of sensory cells within a matrix of sustentacular cells; one population (non-calyceal hair cells) is supplied primarily by boutons and clublike terminals, while the other (calyceal hair cells) is served by calycine terminals that invest from one to five sensory cells. The apices of calyceal hair cells bulge into the utricular lumen and have larger diameters and ciliary counts than non-calyceal cells, but other differences are not marked. Although the bases of calyceal hair cells are deeply indented by calyceal processes, both types show similar afferent synaptic structures confined to the nuclear and infranuclear regions. Efferent terminals synapse on afferent endings and hair cells in both cases; synapses directly on calyceal hair cells lie above the calyx, just beneath the apicolateral junctional complexes. Those complexes are basically similar throughout the receptor, except that a hemispheroidal gap junction between a supporting cell and adjacent hair cell was noted in several instances. Arrays of endoplasmic reticulum and specialized mitochondria occur adjacent to aggregations of afferent synaptic vesicles in both types of sensory cell; it is suggested that such arrays may participate in the production of the vesicles in a process involving membrane recycling similar to that at the neuromuscular junction. Differences between calycine units and the type I hair cell of mammals are discussed, and evidence that suggests an equilibratory function for the lacertilian papilla neglecta is presented.},

	Abstract = {We have compared the melanophore-stimulating action of four phenothiazines, trifluoperazine, perphenazine, chlorpromazine, and prochlorperazine, with alpha-MSH on the skin of the lizard Anolis carolinensis, using a new rate method of bioassay. The dose-response curves for the phenothiazines were parallel to that of alpha-MSH, and when given together alpha-MSH and chlorpromazine were additive. The phenothiazines may therefore stimulate melanosome dispersion in the lizard skin by the same mechanism as alpha-MSH; a MSH-mimetic action of phenothiazines may similarly explain their pigmentary action in man. The pigmentary potency of the phenothiazines corresponded with their therapeutic potency in man; this is in keeping with a neuro-regulatory role for MSH peptides and suggests a possible therapeutic use for them.},

	Abstract = {The ultrastructure of the neural lobe of the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, was studied after fixation in a threefold aldehyde solution. The neural lobe appeared as narrow vertical diverticula separated from one another and from the pars intermedia by a continuous vascular septum. No nerves passed through this septum. The ependymal, fibrous and external layers were readily recognized. Peptidergic fibres were the main component of the fibrous layer. The peptidergic endings were in intimate contact with the ependymal cells, suggesting that the ependyma mediates the release of neural lobe peptides. The external layer contained ependymal end-feet and numerous aminergic terminals, ending directly on the perivascular basal lamina and/or on the ependymal end-feet. The functional aspects are discussed in terms of intermediate lobe control. The findings suggest that aminergic substances take part in the control of the intermedia, but do not exclude the involvement of peptide hormones.},

	Abstract = {The neurointermediate lobes of dark-adapted toads Xenopus laevis were incubated for 30 min in [3H]arginine and then "chased" for various time periods. By use of this pulse-chase paradigm there were detected 10 trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable peptides separated on acid-urea polyacrylamide gels and one TCA-soluble peptide separated by high-voltage electrophoresis (pH 4.9) with melanotropic activity. Each of these peptides had a different degree of melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) activity as revealed by the Anolis skin bioassay. Three of these TCA-precipitable peptides comigrated with ACTH, beta-lipotrophin, and alpha-MSH on acid-urea gels. Evidence suggesting a precursor-product mode of biosynthesis of the melanotropic peptides is presented. 7 of the 10 TCA-precipitable peptides and the one TCA-soluble peptide with melanotropic activity were released into the medium. The half-time of release of the TCA-precipitable peptides was about 2 h, whereas the half-time of TCA-soluble peptide release was about 30 min. The release of these peptides was inhibited by 5 X 10(-5) M dopamine. Dopamine inhibition of release did not appear to affect the biosynthesis of the melanotropic peptides, but did appear to enhance the degradation of the newly synthesized TCA-soluble peptide in the tissue. White adaptation of the toads greatly decreased the biosynthesis of all of the TCA-precipitable melanotropic peptides.},

In Experiment 1 lizards received 14 daily injections of either saline, clomiphene (1, 10 or 20 mcg), or FSH (1 or 10 mcg) or combined clomiphene-FSH treatment. In Experiment 2, adult lizards with hypertrophied, vitellogenic ovaries, and enlarged oviducts, weres adenohypophysectomized and treated with a daily dose of .05 ml of either saline, saline plus 5 mcg clomiphene, saline plus 10 mcg FSH, saline plus 10 mcg estradiol-17beta, or FSH plus clomiphene or estradiol plus clomiphene. FSH increased follicle size in previtellogenic ovaries. Injection of 1 mcg clomiphene reduces the effects of FSH. 20 mcg clomiphene given alone stimulated the growth of larger follicles. Clomiphene blocked FSH-induced appearance or maintenance of large (less than 2.0 mm) vitellogenic follicles. It blocked FSH gains in oviductal weight and well as stimulated growth of small previtellic follicles. Estradiol-induced follicular and oviductal growth was uneffected by clomiphene. While low doses of clomiphene are antiestrogenic they are unable to combat the effects of high dose estradiol.},

	Abstract = {Thermal behavior of parietalectomized, sham-parietalectomized or intact lizards (Anolis carolinensis) was recorded in a test chamber containing moving photothermal gradients. Following parietalectomy, animals chose significantly higher temperatures than sham-parietalectomized or intact control animals, which chose lower and statistically identical temperatures. When pre-surgical and post-surgical means are compared within groups, the eccritic temperature was 2.10 degrees C higher following parietalectomy, 0.72 degrees C higher following sham-parietalectomy, and 0.31 degrees C higher in intact controls during the post-operative measurements. The effects of parietalectomy indicate that the parietalpineal complex may be involved in behavioral thermoregulation by precisely regulating exposure to heat sources (e.g. sunlight).},

Host blood pictures, parasitemia, parasite structure, infection states, and host population dynamics are correlated. Local epidemics occur, but in contrast to temperate zone species there is little regional synchronization. Active infections occur year-around, being somewhat more common in dry seasons; however, chronic infections predominate. Mature schizonts have 3 to 14, usually 6, 8, or 10 merozoites, reduced to 4 to 6 in chronic infections. Gametocytes are round to oblong, measuring 6 by 5 mu, and the pigment in microgametocytes occurs in a single peripheral vacuole. Parasitemia averaged 2.5% and seldom surpassed 20 to 30%. Infections cause significant anemia, and parasites in active infections are most common in immature erythrocytes. Host response is similar to avian or primate infections, including erythropoiesis, phagocytosis, and interference with parasite growth.},

Histamine causes vasodilatation of thecal vessels. Antihistamine blocks the effects of histamine and, when given alone, stimulates vasoconstriction. Antihistamine also blocks estradiol-induced growth of large follicles. These findings are consistent with the above hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {A simple and rapid assay for the quantitative determination of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) activity, using skin fragments of the lizard Anolis carolinensis in vitro, is described in detail. This assay, in which a quantal response (e.g. induction of a brownish-green colour) can be detected by visual observation, allows determination of MSH activity in up to 50 samples/day by one person, using the skin of one lizard. The mean dose found to induce this colour change was 0-15 ng synthetic alpha-MSH/ml (range 0-02-0-5 ng/ml). The assays shows high accuracy, reproducibility and specificity. Anterior and posterior lobe hormones as well as pituitary catecholamines do not interfere with the determination of pituitary MSH activitymthe method is compared with the assay using hypophysectomized frogs (Rana pipiens) in vivo. Determinations of MSH in pituitary extracts by both methods gave quantitatively similar results when determined with alpha-MSH as the reference substance. However, when beta-seryl MSH was used as a reference, the two assays gave different results for the MSH activity of the pituitary extractsmthis indicates that MSH from the rat pituitary gland has a biological activity similar to that of alpha-MSH rather than to that of beta-seryl MSH.},

M. ulcerans was recovered in culture from the slowly progressive lesions which developed at the inoculation site in lizards receiving the viable bacteria. Progressive lesions did not occur in the two control groups. Three patterns of inflammatory response to viable M. ulcerans were observed: 14 lizards developed a diffuse, granulomatous reaction in which acid fast bacilli (AFB) were predominantly intracellular; 1 developed focal, encapsulated granulomas; 5 developed a diffuse, necrotizing granulomatous response in which most AFB were extracellular--similar to the characteristic lesion found in human infections.},

	Abstract = {Resting pituitary melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) content was studied in adult rats kept under a controlled 14 h light-10 h dark regimen. A diurnal rhythm was found in pituitary MSH levels, showing peak values at 4.00-6.00 p.m., and low values during darkness and the beginning of the light period. The normally occurring fall in pituitary MSH content between 6.00 p.m. and midnight was also found in rats exposed to a prolonged photoperiod. Sympathetic denervation of the pineal gland by superior cervical ganglionectomy, as well as pinealectomy, did not block the rhythm in pituitary MSH, and had no effect on pituitary MSH content. In addition, melatonin administered i.v. did not affect pituitary MSH levels, either when MSH activity was tested on the Anolis skin in vitro, or when the in vivo assay with hypophysectomized frogs (Rana pipiens) was used. It was concluded that the diurnal rhythm in pituitary MSH content is not directly related to the light-dark cycle and is not controlled by pineal melatonin or any otherpineal factor.},

	Abstract = {The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of lizard (Anolis carolinensis) myocardial cells has been examined, with particular attention being paid to the structural details of the peripheral couplings (junctional SR). Spheroidal bodies are present within the opaque core of junctional SR; these can be seen both in sections made en face and in sections cut to show the apposition of the junctional SR with the sarcolemma. Opaque junctional processes extend between the sarcolemma and the peripheral junctional SR. The myocardial cells in addition contain some SR cisternae deep within the cells which also possess opaque cores composed of spheroids. Although the significance of the junctional SR spheroidal bodies is unknown, it is thought that they could act as a matrix on which enzymes such as calcium-specific ATPase may be located.},

New fine-structural details are revealed, and their importance is discussed. Of some interest is the complex of filaments between crystalline sheets in the cell. It is proposed that this complex is involved in the arrangement of crystals into crystalline sheets, and that the crystal arrangement and spacing are critical for the production of the cells' blue-green color. Tyndall scattering and thin-film interference are discussed as possible explanations for iridophore color production in relation to the fine-structural data obtained.},

Only the median eye lens exhibited fluorescence specific for the crystallins; other structures were negative. These results indicate that the lens of the reptilean median eye shares tissue-specific antigenic determinants with the lens of the lateral eye. This suggests a possible evolutionary relation between the two structures, based on biochemical, as well as previously reported anatomical, criteria.},

The response to this hormone is directly related to the concentration of the Ca(2+) ion. Lithium, choline, rubidium, and cesium will replace the sodium and potassium of Ringer solution if Ca(2+) is present. Calcium ions are not required for melanosome dispersion itself, since theophylline or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate reversibly darkens lizard skins in the absence of calcium.},

@article{Goldman:1970aa,
	Abstract = {1. Skins of the lizard Anolis carolinensis darken in vitro in response to melanophore stimulating hormone (MSH), a peptide hormone, as well as to catecholamines. These hormones darken Anolis skins by dispersing the sub-cellular organelle, the melanosome, out into the dendritic processes of the dermal melanophores.2. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and methylxanthines also darken skins. In addition, methylxanthines are synergistic with both catecholamines and MSH in causing skin darkening. These data suggest that the dispersion of melanosomes within melanophores in response to both MSH and catecholamines is mediated by cyclic AMP.3. alpha-Adrenoceptor blocking agents inhibit MSH-induced darkening but potentiate catecholamine-induced darkening. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents, in contrast, inhibit catecholamine-induced darkening but have no effect on MSH-induced darkening. This selective blockade of one receptor while the functional integrity of the other receptor is maintained suggests that MSH and catecholamines increase cyclic AMP levels through different receptors.4. Catecholamines exert their action through beta-adrenoceptors; MSH darkens skins through what appears to be a component of the alpha-adrenoceptor. beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation may stimulate adenyl cyclase to increase cyclic AMP levels whereas MSH may inhibit cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase thereby preventing cyclic AMP breakdown.},

@article{Hadley:1969aa,
	Abstract = {1. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP has been reported to darken skins of the frog, Rana pipiens. This suggests that cyclic 3',5'-AMP may mediate the action of MSH on amphibian chromatophores. Since MSH also darkens skins of the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, we investigated the effects of cyclic 3',5'-AMP and other nucleotides on Anolis melanophores to determine whether cyclic 3',5'-AMP may be the intracellular mediator of hormone action on melanophores of another vertebrate class.2. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP, itself, causes a rapid melanin granule aggregation within melanophores of Anolis. This response is, however, somewhat nonspecific in that both 5'-ATP and 5'-ADP also lighten the skins by aggregating the melanin granules. Another nucleotide, 5'-AMP, darkens the skins by dispersing melanin granules. Cyclic 2',3'-AMP does not darken or lighten Anolis skins.3. Dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP, which is considered to be better able to penetrate membranes and resist degradation by a specific phosphodiesterase, maximally darkens Anolis skins, as does MSH. This darkening by the potent dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP suggests that cyclic 3',5'-AMP may be the intracellular mediator of melanin granule dispersion within Anolis melanophores leading to skin darkening.4. Other evidence supporting the first-messenger-second-messenger hypothesis for melanophore regulation is discussed.5. The differences in responses of Anolis melanophores to adenine nucleotides may relate to the ability of these agents to penetrate melanophore membranes; thus, the nucleotides could exert their effects either intracellularly or extracellularly on the plasma membrane.},

@article{Haslewood:1969aa,
	Abstract = {1. Bile salts of Petromyzon marinus L. ammocoetes appeared to consist solely or chiefly of a crystalline substance, whose chromatographic and i.r.-spectral characteristics suggested that it was a monosulphate ester of a bile alcohol having the 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy pattern of substitution in a 5alpha-steroid nucleus. 2. This substance on cleavage with dioxan-trichloroacetic acid gave petromyzonol, n.m.r. and mass-spectral examination of which suggested the structure 5alpha-cholane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrol. 3. 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-Trihydroxy-5alpha-cholanoic acid (allocholic acid) from the lizards Anolis lineatopus lineatopus Gray and Cyclura carinata Harlan (family Iguanidae) was esterified with propan-1-ol and reduced by lithium aluminium hydride to 5alpha-cholane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrol, identical with petromyzonol. 4. Chromic acid oxidation of petromyzonol sulphate from lamprey bile, followed by acid hydrolysis, gave 24-hydroxy-5alpha-cholane-3,7,12-trione; hence the sulphate ester group is at C-24. 5. Petromyzonol sulphate is both primitive and unique: a study of its biogenesis might improve our understanding of evolution at the molecular level.},

Adult males on the average eat a smaller number of prey, and the range in size of prey is larger. The relationship between the average length of the prey and that of the predator is linear when the predator size is above 36 millimeters, but becomes asymptotic when it is below that value. Subadult males as long as adult females eat significantly larger food than do the latter, but only in the larger lizards is this correlated with a relatively larger head. Anolis conspersus selects prey from a wide range of taxa and shows no obvious intraspecific specialization not connected to differences in microhabitat and prey size. The efficiency of this system for solitary species is pointed out.},

When based on protein analyses, identifications of individuals may be less equivocal than identification based on descriptions of skin color and markings.

Such evidence often confirms estimates of relationship derived from more traditional criteria and in some cases provides a basis for formulating new taxonomic conclusions.},

	Abstract = {Clark, H Fred (Communicable Disease Center, Atlanta, Ga.), and Charles C. Shepard. Effect of environmental temperatures on infection with Mycobacterium marinum (Balnei) of mice and a number of poikilothermic species. J. Bacteriol. 86:1057-1069. 1963.-An exploration was made of the effect of environmental temperature on infections with Mycobacterium marinum of mice, young opossums, and bats, and of 50 species of poikilothermic animals. In artificial medium (7H9 broth) M. marinum grew most rapidly from 25 to 35 C, with generation times of 4 to 6 hr. At 37 C, the generation time was 14 hr; at 20 C, 20 hr; and, at 15 C and lower, little growth was observed. In mice, deep body temperatures were found to be 36.5 to 37.3 C at environmental temperatures of 4 to 30 C. At an environmental temperature of 34 C, they averaged 39.1 C; at 37 C they averaged 40.2 C. Foot-pad temperatures were within a few degrees of ambient temperatures from 10 to 34 C. In mouse foot-pad infections, the optimal environmental temperature for infection was 20 C, and the generation time of the infecting bacilli at this environmental temperature was about 15 hr. Intravenously inoculated mice developed peripheral infections of nose, feet, and tail at environmental temperatures of 4 to 30 C. At these temperatures, they had severe pneumonic involvement, and the mice at lower temperatures tended to succumb most rapidly to systemic infection. At 34 C, the intravenously infected mice did not develop peripheral infections and there was no pulmonary involvement. Young opossums, whose deep body temperatures are only 34 to 36 C, were inoculated in the foot-pad and intravenously. Foot-pad infection developed without systemic involvement. Bats, which assume environmental temperature when at rest, were inoculated in the foot-pad. Foot-pad infections were observed but no systemic disease. The bats could be maintained for only short periods, however. Poikilothermic animals were studied. Deep body temperatures were found to be nearly identical with ambient temperature. A total of 50 species of reptiles, amphibians, and fish were infected intraperitoneally in a number of experiments, as animals were available. Susceptibility to M. marinum was found throughout these species. There was no tendency to peripheral involvement. In experiments to determine the optimal environmental temperature for infection, cricket frogs (Acris), American chameleons (Anolis), young garter snakes (Thamnophis), and the young of three species of turtles were inoculated intraperitoneally. The optimal temperature for infection was found to be 30 C in each case, and infections at 20 C were definitely slower. The generation time of M. marinum in American chameleons at 30 C was about 19 hr; at 20 C, it was about 46 hr; and, at 10 C, the bacilli did not apparently multiply. Transmission studies revealed instances where infected animals shed M. marinum into the waters in which they were kept, and where animals became infected from water containing M. marinum.},

Under conditions of direct-coupled amplification, with glass pipette electrodes recording extracellularly from the retinal surface, the response consisted of an increase in negativity maintained throughout prolonged illumination. With capacitance-coupled amplification and metal electrodes, brisk mass discharges of nerve impulses were detected at the onset and cessation of illumination. During illumination a less vigorous maintained discharge was observed.},

	Abstract = {Myoneural junctions in Anolis are characterized by the formation of troughs in the surface of the muscle fibers in which small branches of the terminal axon lie. The muscle surface membrane lining the troughs is thrown into complex branching and anastomosing folds, which compose the subneural apparatus of Couteaux. A compound membrane 500 to 700 A thick separates axoplasm from sarcoplasm at the endings. This consists of five distinct layers and is described in detail. A thin layer of cytoplasm (probably Schwann) separates terminal axoplasm from extracellular space at the surfaces of the junctional troughs. Terminal axoplasm lacks axoplasmic filaments and contains numerous vesicular or tubular appearing structures about 300 to 500 A in diameter. Both terminal axoplasm and sarcoplasm contain numerous mitochondria.},

	Abstract = {Flicker contours from vertebrates (fishes to man) show that the slope parameter sigma'(log I) in the efficiently descriptive probability summation 100 F/F(max.) = integral(-inf;) (log I)e(-(log I/I(i))(-(log I/I(i))2)/2(sigma')(/2(sigma')2) ) .d log I is distributed bimodally (simple fields, "white" light), from 0.60 to 2.3, with well defined peaks at 0.80 and 1.75. This parameter is independent of F(max.), log I(i), temperature, light-time fraction, and in general not greatly influenced by lambda. "Rod" components of known visually duplex contours, without exception, and some "cone" contours, are in the first group; an equal number of "cone" curves are in the second group, together with one simplex "rod" contour; purely cone contours are in each group, as well as cone segments of duplex curves. No firm zoological grouping of the "cone" curves can be made, on present evidence,-although the 5 fishes used give high-slope curves, 2 amphibians low slopes, reptiles (5) either high or low, birds (2) and anthropoids (2) low-slope "cone" curves. By subdivision of the visual image and by change of wave-length, under certain conditions, in man, and by use of the "pecten effect" in birds (and man), cone contours of the low-slope class can be transformed into curves of the high-slope group. These procedures do not fundamentally change the "rod" slopes. Consequently, although under simple conditions they are specifically determined, the forms of the F - log I contour cannot be used as diagnostic for rod or cone functioning. It is reinforced, by new data on Anolis (lizard) and Trionyx (turtle), that an obviously duplex retina is specifically correlated with a duplex performance contour, a simplex retina with a simplex one. But no support is given to the view that the shapes of these curves are diagnostic of differences in rod or cone fundamental excitabilities, or that they describe properties of these units. In visual duplexity we have to do simply with the fact that two groups of neural effects are available; it is with their properties that we deal in measurements of duplex visual excitability.},

@article{Hoagland:1928aa,
	Abstract = {1. The durations of successive periods of induced tonic immobility in the lizard Anolis carolinensis was examined as a function of temperature. An automatic recording method was employed and observations were made of 12,000 to 15,000 immobilizations with six animals over a temperature range of 5 degrees to 35 degrees C. during 5 months. 2. The durations of the immobile periods were found to vary rhythmically in most cases. The reciprocal of the duration of the rhythm, i.e., the rate of change of the process underlying the rhythms, when plotted as a function of temperature according to the Arrhenius equation show distributions of points in two straight line groups. One of these groups or bands of points extends throughout the entire temperature range with a temperature characteristic of approximately micro = 31,000 calories, and the other covers the range of 20 degrees to 35 degrees C. with micro equal to approximately 9,000 calories. 3. The initial stimulus in a series of inductions of immobility appears to set off a mechanism which determines the duration of the state of quiescence. Succeeding forced recoveries seem to have no effect on the normal duration of the rhythm. 4. These results are interpreted by assuming the release, through reflex stimulation, of hormonal substances, one effective between 5 degrees and 35 degrees C. and the other effective between 20 degrees and 35 degrees C. These substances are assumed to act as selective inhibitors of impulses from so called "higher centers," allowing impulses from tonic centers to pass to the muscles. 5. In some experiments a progressive lengthening in successively induced periods of immobility was observed. The logarithm of the frequency of recovery when plotted against time in most of these cases (i.e., except for a few in which irregularities occurred) gave a linear function of negative slope which was substantially unaffected by temperature. In these cases it is assumed that a diffusion process is controlling the amount of available A substance. 6. The results are similar to those obtained by Crozier with Cylisticus convexus. The duration of tonic immobility seems to be maintained in both arthropod and vertebrate by the chemical activity of "hormonal" selective inhibitors. The details of the mechanisms differ, but there is basic similarity. 7. Injections of small amounts of adrenalin above a threshold value are found to prolong the durations of tonic immobility of Anolis, by an amount which is a logarithmic function of the "dose." It is possible that internally secreted adrenalin, above a threshold amount, may be involved in the maintenance of tonic immobility. 8. The production of tonic immobility reflexly is a problem distinct from that of the duration of immobility. It is suggested that the onset may be induced by "shock" to the centers of reflex tonus causing promiscuous discharge of these centers with accompanying inhibition of the higher centers. Such a condition may result when an animal is suddenly lifted from the substratum and overturned, or when, as in the case of Anolis, it struggles with dorsum down. This reaction of the "tonic centers" may at the same time lead to discharge of the adrenal glands by way of their spinal connections thus prolonging the state.},

	Abstract = {Eight adult male lizards of the genus and species Anolis carolinensis were used in this experiment. In order to induce aggressive responding, animals were caged separately and daily underwent pairing with another male, during which aggressive responses and changes in skin color were measured. After obtaining a baseline measure of aggressive responding, animals were injected either with fluoxetine or vehicle-controls in a cross-over design. Subjects were then exposed to five more days of (non drug) pairing with the intruder male, after which they underwent a second trial with fluoxetine/vehicle. Finally, two post-drug paired-trials were obtained. Fluoxetine injection significantly reduced the aggressive responding in the males while causing the postorbital eyespot to significantly darken. Subjects also showed increased aggressivity and skin-color reactivity subsequent to the two drug trials, although it is unclear if the fluoxetine, or non-specific factors of the injection paradigm, accounted for these changes. These results suggest that serotonergic CNS systems tonically regulate aggression in Anolis carolinesis, similar to that seen in many other species. They further suggest that eyespot-darkening and aggressive responding can be pharmacologically dissociated, implicating serotonin in the regulation of this phenomenon.},

@article{Morales:1996aa,
	Abstract = {Tropical anoline lizards have been shown to undergo massive reproductive retrogression when held in captivity. The present study focused on the effects generated by captivity-induced stress on the hepatic expression of vitellogenin (Vtg), the precursor of the major egg yolk proteins, in Anolis pulchellus. Several hepatic dysfunctions accompanying the regression of the reproductive organs were detected when mature highly vitellogenic females were kept in captivity for long periods. These included decreased synthesis of Vtg to undetectable levels after 4 days of captivity concomitant with a large reduction in the levels of its cognate mRNA. In addition, a drastic reduction in Vtg plasma levels preceding the conspicuous cessation of follicular growth was observed. Results suggest the activation of a specific mechanism for rapid clearance of vitellogenic and other female-specific proteins from plasma. The effects of captivity, both in the liver and in the reproductive tract, were alleviated or even reversed by treatment with 17 Beta-estradiol. Hepatic protein synthesis increased threefold when animals were maintained under estrogen therapy during the captivity period. Also, the levels of Vtg mRNA and Vtg protein synthesis and plasma levels were similar or even higher to the observed in control vitellogenic females. Animals treated with 17 beta-estradiol after long-term captivity recovered the normal vitellogenic levels after 72 to 96 hr. Therefore, our results im this tropical anole strongly suggest that the stress effects upon reproductive behavior previously reported in anoline lizards results from suppression of the estrogen stimulus for the hepatic vitellogenic response.},

	Abstract = {The formation of the meninges around the new spinal cord of the regenerating tail of the lizards Anolis and Lampropholis has been studied after injection of 3H-thymidine and 3H-proline. An optical and electron microscopic autoradiographical study revealed that many irregular 3H-thymidine labeled meningeal fibroblasts surround the apical regenerating spinal cord. Meningeal fibroblasts become flat at about 0.5-1 mm from the tail tip while they actively uptake 3H-proline involved in the synthesis of collagen and elastin. Elastic fibres are in intimate contact with the meningeal fibroblasts. One hour after injection of 3H-proline trace grains were seen most in the Golgi apparatus and secretory elastin-like vesicles. The importance of the elastic fibrils around the caudal spinal cord of lizard in relation to the body movements is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The development of scales was analysed in embryos of the Jamaican Iguanid lizard Anolis lineatopus after the injection of cell proliferation markers [3H]thymidine and 5-bromodeoxyuridine. Embryos were fixed at successive postinjection periods, from 2 h up to 13 d and sections of developing skin were studied by autoradiography and immunocytochemistry. The epidermis during the initial stages of morphogenesis (flat epidermis and symmetric scale stages) expands chiefly by the tangential proliferation of the basal layer. The superficial periderm took part in its own laminar expansion. The rates of proliferation in the epidermis and dermis were similar during the flat epidermal stage, but dermal proliferation decreased under the wave-like epidermis of symmetric scales. No specific localisation of proliferating cells was visible either in the epidermis and or the dermis at these 2 early stages. Scale asymmetry is brought about by cell multiplication and hypertrophy of the cells of the future outer surface of the scale that behaves as an epithelial placode capable of producing beta-keratinised cells. The growth of the outer surface determines the asymmetry of the scale. Conversely, the future inner side and hinge region showed a lower degree of cell proliferation and cells remained cuboidal or became flat. Also the proliferation of the dermis under the scaling epidermis was significantly diminished. During the asymmetric scale stage, labelled cells were more common in the hypertrophied basel epithelium from 2 h until 4 d postinjection, during which time a few cells moved into the upper keratinizing layers. At 6-13 d postinjection, labelled cells were commonly seen in the upper beta-keratinising layers.},

	Abstract = {The recognition of liver and serum polypeptides in Anolis pulchellus by a polyclonal antibody against S1-lipovitellin confirmed their identity as vitellogenins (Vtg) and demonstrated their structural relationship to yolk lipoproteins. In vivo labeling demonstrated active synthesis of Vtg by vitellogenic females since intracellular incorporation of [3H]-leucine was detected at short periods of label in all five Anolis Vtg forms. Time course analysis of 3H-Vtg levels indicated a 1 hr lag phase between synthesis and secretion. On the other hand, 32P-Vtg appears to be rapidly secreted from the liver into the blood since label was detected simultaneously in both compartments. After 2 hr intracellular 32P-Vtg levels reached a plateau. Decreasing 32P-Vtg levels in the blood were observed several hours after injection. In growing oocytes 32P was detected in yolk phosphoproteins ranging from 37,000 to 75,000 in molecular weight. Based on these results together with previous published data we conclude that in tropical anole the yolk phosphoproteins appear to be derived from the larger highly phosphorylated Vtg forms according to the typical vertebrate Vtg precursor-product relationship. However, the main component of yolk lipovitellin is synthesized in the liver as an independent lipoprotein (Vtg-116) which is taken up by growing oocytes without major proteolytic modifications. This novel mode of lipovitellin biosynthesis and deposit in reptiles has not been reported previously.},

Lowest prevalence occurred at dry, windy sites or cool, wet mountain peaks (0-20%); the parasites were more common at most other locations on the island (40-80% infected; overall prevalence = 47%). High and low prevalence sites sometimes were only a few hundred meters apart. Prevalence was similar for males and females but increased with body size except for a decline in the largest ( = oldest) lizards. A surplus of mixed infections (P. floridense and P. azurophilum together in the same host) existed compared with chance proportions. Parasitemia generally was low; 70% of P. floridense infections were < or = 100 parasites/10,000 erythrocytes, and 70% of P. azurophilum infections were < or = 50/10,000.

	Abstract = {Recent biochemical and immunocytochemical evidence indicates that a population of circadian and reproductive rhythm-entraining photoreceptors lies in the basal diencephalon of iguanid lizards. Here, we report the results of correlated light and electron microscopy of opsin-immunoreactive cells in the basal brain, and we discuss their ultrastructural relationship to known photoreceptors. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting bipolar neurons in the lizards Anolis carolinensis and Iguana iguana were immunolabeled with antisera generated against vertebrate retinal opsins and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Within the brain, opsin-immunoreactive cells were found exclusively in the ependyma of the basal region of the lateral ventricles (adjacent to nucleus paraolfactorius/nucleus ventromedialis and neostriatum/paleostriatum). Cells in the same anatomical location and with the same morphology were labeled with anti-VIP antisera. These cells possessed a dendritic process that extended toward the lateral ventricle, ending in a bulbous terminal that protruded into the ventricle. Axonal processes travelled ventrally and caudally. The entire cell, including the axonal process, exhibited opsin-like and VIP-like immunoreactivity. By light microscopy, opsin-like immunostaining appeared punctate, with immunoreactivity greatest in the bulbous terminal. Opsin- and VIP-immunostained thick sections were resectioned, and individual cells observed by light microscopy were then characterized using electron microscopy. We found that all immunostained cells were morphologically similar and that they were morphologically distinct from neighboring nonimmunoreactive cells. CSF-contacting opsin- and VIP-immunoreactive cells lacked the membranous stacks characteristic of retinal photoreceptors but were ciliated and contained numerous large electron-dense vesicles. Multiple synaptic contacts were made on the soma and putative dendritic processes of opsin- and VIP-immunoreactive CSF-contacting neurons. Our results provide the first ultrastructural characterization of opsin-immunostained encephalic CSF-contacting neurons in a vertebrate animal, and they indicate that these putative photoreceptors share structural features with pineal photoreceptors and with certain invertebrate extraretinal photoreceptors, but they are morphologically and biochemically distinct from visual photoreceptors of the retina.},

@article{Schneider:1996aa,
	Abstract = {Distinguishing between primary and secondary intergradation among differentiated populations, and the relative importance of drift and selection, are persistent problems in evolutionary biology. An historical perspective on population interactions can provide insight into the nature of contacts, and thus help resolve these questions. Continuously distributed populations of Anolis marmoratus from the island of Basse Terre in the Guadeloupean archipelago of the Lesser Antilles show a striking degree of geographic variation in morphology. Initial surveys of mtDNA variation from throughout the Guadeloupean Archipelago revealed one case where levels of sequence difference and phylogenetic relationships of alleles from morphologically differentiated populations from the east coast of Basse Terre were consistent with primary intergradation. In this paper, I examine the genetic population structure of a series of populations spanning this north-south cline in morphological variation to test the hypothesis of primary intergradation. Sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene from 50 individuals representing five populations spanning the cline were obtained and fourteen unique haplotypes (differing by 2% or less) were detected. Patterns of nucleotide substitution among haplotypes do not deviate from neutral expectation indicating no effect of selection at the level of mtDNA sequences. Estimates of population structure and gene flow were made using both summary statistics for nucleotide diversity (Nst) and cladistic methods. The results are sensitive to the choice of gene flow model, and this is discussed in detail. Mitochondrial variation in the northern populations may not be at equilibrium, and the phylogeny of alleles is consistent with a recent increase in effective population size. Estimates of nucleotide diversity, gene flow, and the phylogenetic relationships of haplotypes indicate that the southern-most population (representing the extreme of morphological variation along this cline) has been relatively isolated from populations to the north and has experienced a reduced effective population size. The apparent clinal variation between the southern population and the others may therefore reflect secondary contact and introgression rather than primary intergradation.},

	Abstract = {Autoradiographic mapping criteria were employed to identify and localize specific high affinity binding sites (receptors) for the steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) in the brain of Anolis carolinensis. In female and male lizards binding of tritiated 1,25-D3 occurred in identical regions of the fore-, mid-, and hindbrain, similar to findings in other species. There was a band of intensely labeled neurons forming a continuum from the n. accumbens, n. striae terminalis, the striatum, and extending into the amygdala. Target areas with high to intermediate labeling intensities were present in many other regions of the brain and single, small target cells were found throughout the organ. Some cells in the pituitary and pineal were labeled and also cells associated with the meninges, choroid plexuses and ependyma. The differential labeling suggests the existence of different 1,25-D3-responsive systems. One of the conspicuous "high capacity-high affinity systems" is found in the n. accumbens-n. striae terminalis and the amygdala. Most of the cerebral target regions for vitamin D correspond to those known for gonadal steroids, and the seasonal steroid 1,25-D3 may therefore act in conjunction with gonadal steroids in this seasonally breeding reptile.},

Skinks and anoles were exposed by needle inoculation or tick bite to B. burgdorferi. Xenodiagnosis with larval Ixodes scapularis and culture of tissues were used to asses infection and the ability of infected lizards to infect attached ticks. Both lizard species were susceptible to B. burgdorferi by both routes of exposure. Xenodiagnostic ticks acquired spirochetes while feeding on both species. One tick that dropped from a skink on the ninth day after exposure was infected. The remainder of xenodiagnostic ticks that acquired spirochetes fed three weeks after exposure of the lizards to the spirochete. Lizards remained infectious to attached ticks for at least five weeks. Overall, more than 20% of xenodiagnostic larvae fed on southeastern five-lined skinks acquired spirochetes. Individual skinks infected up to 34% of attached ticks. A smaller proportion of ticks feeding on green anoles became infected. Borrelia burgdorferi recovered from infected lizards retained their infectivity for mammalian hosts. The ability of the lizards to sustain a Borrelia infection and infect attached ticks suggests that they may play a role in the maintenance of spirochete transmission.},

	Abstract = {Receptor autoradiography was used for the demonstration of specific binding of the tritiated steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the eyes and associated tissues of Anolis carolinensis. A 100-fold excess of non-labelled 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 abolished specific nuclear binding of tracer. Nuclear [3H]-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 binding was present in all animals in the retina stratum ganglionare and stratum nuclear externum as well as in the cornea; however, binding was absent in the optic nerve, except in cells of the surrounding arachnoidea. Additional cranial tissues such as chondrocytes in the sclera, parasphenoid, skeletal muscle cells, and epithelial cells of the lacrimal and Harderian glands exhibited nuclear labelling. The results suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has genomic regulatory actions that involve cell proliferation, differentiation, and functions of certain cells of the eye and associated cranial tissues. The presence of vitamin D receptors in tissues of the eye and skeletal muscle in the reptile is in part different from that observed in mammals. In general, receptors for vitamin D and related target tissues appear to be even more extensive in lizards than has been observed in rodents, which may reflect a more extensive dependency of these tissues on solar environment and active seasonal and circadian regulation.},

This RH2 group includes the green-sensitive opsins in chicken and goldfish and the blue-sensitive opsin in a nocturnal lizard gecko. In the present study, we isolated and sequenced the genomic DNA clones for the RH2 opsin gene, rh2Ac, of the diurnal lizard Anolis carolinensis. This single-copy gene spans 18.3 kb from start to stop codons, making it the longest opsin gene known in vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis strongly suggests that rh2Ac is more closely related to the chicken green opsin gene than to the gecko blue opsin gene. This gene tree differs from the organismal tree, where the two lizard species should be most closely related, implying that rh2Ac and the gecko blue-sensitive opsin genes have been derived from duplicate ancestral genes.},

	Abstract = {We used the transmembrane distribution of 5,5-[2-14C]dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione ([14C]DMO) and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to investigate the effects of hypercapnia on intracellular pH (pHi) in brain and skeletal muscle of two lizard species: Anolis equestris and Dipsosaurus dorsalis. In control animals (normocapnic), plasma PCO2 (3.3 +/- 0.1 kPa) and plasma pH (7.52 +/- 0.01) for D. dorsalis were not significantly different from the values for A. equestris (2.8 +/- 0.2 kPa and 7.59 +/- 0.02, respectively). Furthermore 60 min of 5% CO2 increased plasma PCO2 and decreased plasma pH by the same amounts in both species. Brain pHi values determined with the DMO method were not significantly different from values determined with NMR. Control values of brain pHi (DMO, 7.16 +/- 0.01; NMR, 7.11 +/- 0.02) and muscle pHi were significantly higher for D. dorsalis (DMO, 7.15 +/- 0.03) than for A. equestris (DMO, 6.99 +/- 0.03; NMR, 7.02 +/- 0.02 for brain; DMO, 6.97 +/- 0.03 for muscle). In addition, changes in tissue pHi after 60 min of 5% CO2 were significantly different for the two species. In D. dorsalis muscle and brain pHi decreased significantly after hypercapnia, whereas in A. equestris muscle pHi decreased significantly but brain pHi was unchanged. Our findings were independent of the methods used to determine pHi. The smaller change in brain and muscle pHi than in plasma pH for A. equestris is consistent with the view that pHi regulation involves active processes such as transmembrane ion transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {In order to study the pattern of growth of regenerating cartilage, H3-thymidine was injected in individuals of the lizards Anolis carolinensis and Lampropholis delicata during advanced stages of tail regeneration. Light and electron microscopic autoradiographical analysis showed that the regenerating cartilaginous tube was mostly derived from the interstitial proliferation of chondroblasts. Appositional growth is limited during the initial stages of cartilage formation. Later, after the differentiation of an inner and outer perichondrium, a few cells were added to the cartilaginous tube while cellular degeneration of the calcifying areas was in progress. In this way a constant diameter of the cartilaginous tube was maintained. In order to study the rate of production of matrix protein (collagen), H3-proline was administered to other samples of Lampropholis. To the best of the author's knowledge this was done for the first time in the cartilage of a reptiles. The tracier was mostly localized in the apical-intermediate cartilage and one hour postinjection it was mostly concentrated in the ergastoplasm around the Golgi apparatus and its secretory vesicles. Three hours after the injection of H3-proline some of the tracier was found in the cytoplasm of chondrocytes and in the extracellular matrix.},

	Abstract = {The differentiation of muscles in the lizards Anolis and Lampropholis with tails that had regenerated for 21-50 d was investigated by light and electron microscope autoradiography using tritiated thymidine. At the apex of the regenerating tail, groups of 4-8 myoblasts of the promuscle aggregates fused to produce bundles of myotubes whose multiple labelled and unlabelled nuclei appeared to be distributed at random. The formation of the first myotubes and their growth is responsible for the formation of the myotome primordia and their separation from the intermuscular connective myosepta. More nuclei were added with the lengthening of the myotubes--up to 14-18 nuclei in the oldest proximal myotubes. At 4-5 h after injection labelled nuclei were found outside the myotubes while at 2-6 d after injection many labelled nuclei were observed in the myotubes, particularly near the two ends of the myotubular sarcoplasm contacting the myoseptum. This change from the initial distribution suggests that the growth of the myotubes takes place mostly at their terminals. There is an apparent correlation between the number of nuclei and the final length of the myotubes and myotome. The insertion of fibres with a similar number of nuclei and lengths into the pinnated connective myoseptum of the original musculature, the autotomy plane, probably determines the wave-like shape of the muscles within the regenerated myotomes.},

	Abstract = {Many stimuli, including social aggression, activate endocrine stress mechanisms, presumably mediated or modulated by central neurotransmitters. To determine the effects of aggression on central neurochemistry, reproductively active male Anolis carolinensis were paired and allowed to establish social dominance relationships. While combatants cohabited, the fight losers invariably became socially subordinate and displayed darker color, selection of lower perch sites, and lower body posture than the winners. After one hour, one day, one week, or one month of cohabitation animals were sacrificed. Each member of a pair was killed at approximately the same time, along with animals kept isolated as controls. Diencephalon, non-optic lobe midbrain and hindbrain were analyzed for indoleamines, catecholamines and metabolites by coulochem electrode array HPLC. Early activation (by one hour) of the serotonergic system in subordinate male lizards was indicated by decreased serotonin (5-HT), increased 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio. Substrate 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP) also increased in losing males, suggesting enhanced production as well as turnover. Significant 5-HTP and 5-HIAA/5-HT increases for subordinate males, compared with levels in control and dominant males, were greatest at one hour and diminished thereafter. This pattern of indoleamine system activation is consistent with stress-induced stimulation of the serotonergic system and prolonged activation of the stress response in subordinate animals, as well as serotonergic inhibition of aggression. In contrast with serotonin, subordinate males did not have increased catecholamine system activation following one hour of interaction. The ratio of DOPAC/dopamine was lower following one hour of interaction in subordinate males. Adrenergic system activation, indicated by metanephrine/epinephrine ratio, increased with time in losing males, except that after one month of cohabitation, turnover returned to levels that equaled those of control animals. Noradrenergic metabolite MHPG, as well as MHPG/NE ratio, were significantly reduced in dominant males at one hour and one week. Changes in adrenergic system activation, not seen in or registered by noradrenergic systems, indicate a possible role for central epinephrine in social stress accommodation.},

	Abstract = {Photocrosslinking of receptors for alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) on melanophores of frogs and lizards has been shown to induce long-lasting receptor stimulation whereby the photoreactive alpha-MSH may contain one or two photolabels in positions 1, 7, 9, or 13. The chemical synthesis and biological testing of an alpha-MSH analogue is now described which contains three photoreactive groups in positions 1, 9 and 13, one of which with a cleavable S-S disulphide bridge: [ApSSpr-Ser1, Trp(Naps)9 Pap13]-alpha-MSH. Photocrosslinking of MSH receptors on melanophores of Anolis carolinensis with this analogue led to almost complete receptor blockade which could be transformed into long-lasting receptor stimulation by exposure to a thiol reagent. By contrast, the analogue containing only two photoreactive groups in positions 9 and 13, [Trp(Naps)9, Pap13]-alpha-MSH, produced long-lasting receptor stimulation which was not altered by the thiol reagent. These results demonstrate that one and the same peptide ligand may contain structural information for both receptor activation and inhibition and that the receptor may become arrested in an activated or inhibited state by multiple photocrosslinking, depending on the relative positions of these crosslinks.},

In the present study, we isolated and sequenced a genomic DNA clone for the A. carolinensis Rh gene. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence revealed six A. carolinensis-specific replacements in conserved aa residues among vertebrate Rhs. Four out of these six replacements (S22N, N199H, E232A and T319M) reside outside the transmembrane (TM) domains. Some of these replacements might have been required for Rh to function solely in the pineal gland.},

	Abstract = {During scale morphogenesis in the regenerating tail of lizards (Anolis and Lampropholis) the structure of the dermis undergoes changes in relation to the ingrowth of epidermal papillae to form the new scales. Cell proliferation in the dermis, as revealed by the uptake of 3H-thymidine, is high in the prescaling region of the regenerating tail but lower than the proliferation in the epidermis. Under the epidermis of the scaling region dermal cell proliferation rapidly drops down under the distal (apical) and proximal (caudal) sides of the infolding epidermal papillae. Dermal fibroblasts take up 3H-proline in high amounts, especially in the forming deep dermal layer, where many collagen fibrils are laid down forming dense connective. Electron microscopic study revealed that "anchoring filaments" link the basement membrane of the epidermis with the deep dermis, in particular in the sinking hinge region. As a result of the higher proliferation of the epidermis with respect to the dermis (heterochrony) and the presence of dermo-epithelial "anchoring filaments", the superficial laminar epidermis sinks into the dermis to produce new scales. The epidermal downpushing is evidenced by a characteristic distortion of the dermal fibrils under the distal and the proximal sides, and in the hinge region of the forming scales.},

@article{Grace:1994aa,
	Abstract = {Melatonin modulates a variety of rhythmic processes in vertebrates, and is synthesized in both the retina and pineal gland. We have shown previously that retinal melatonin is deacetylated generating 5-methoxytryptamine, which is then deaminated by monoamine oxidase, producing 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol. This process occurs within the eyes of a variety of vertebrates including the iguanid lizard Anolis carolinensis. To determine whether melatonin deacetylase activity also occurs in the pineal organ or in other parts of the lizard brain, pineals and brains of Anolis carolinensis and Sceloporus jarrovi were cultured in the presence of [3H-methoxy]-melatonin. High-performance liquid chromatography of the resulting culture media and tissues revealed the generation of radiolabeled 5-methoxytryptamine and 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid. These two methoxyindoles were the only radiolabeled metabolites detectable, and together accounted for all melatonin lost. Both the loss of melatonin and the production of melatonin metabolites were inhibited by inclusion of 100 microM eserine, an inhibitor of the melatonin deacetylase. Pargyline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, reduced the production of 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and increased the production of 5-methoxytryptamine relative to control incubations. Similar effects of eserine and pargyline were seen in eyecup, brain and pineal gland, but the specific activity of melatonin deacetylation in cultured pineal glands was much greater than in either brains or eyecups. These results indicate that pineal glands of both Anolis carolinensis and Sceloporus jarrovi can rapidly catabolize melatonin by a mechanism very similar to that in the eye, that the melatonin deacetylation pathway exists elsewhere in the iguanid brain, and also extend our previous observations of ocular melatonin deacetylation to an additional species.},

	Abstract = {Acid extracts of the pars intermedia of the squamate reptile Lacerta galloti were screened for immunoreactive forms of proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-related end products following Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. alpha-MSH-sized end products were detected with a Val-NH2, C-terminal-specific RIA, and beta-endorphin-sized end products were detected with a separate C-terminal-directed RIA. Five peaks of alpha-MSH-related immunoreactivity were isolated following fractionation by reversed-phase HPLC. Based on a comparison of the reversed-phase HPLC properties and the net positive charges (pH 2.75) of the Lacerta forms of alpha-MSH to those of the mammalian forms of alpha-MSH and Anolis carolinensis ACTH(1-13)NH2, it appears that the N-acetylation of alpha-MSH is a major post-translational processing event in the pars intermedia of L. galloti. Although multiple forms of beta-endorphin were detected in the pars intermedia of L. galloti following cation-exchange chromatography, the low levels of N-acetylated beta-endorphin detected with an N-acetyl-specific beta-endorphin RIA indicate that the N-acetylation of beta-endorphin in this species is a minor post-translational processing event. This pattern of POMC processing in the pars intermedia of L. galloti is similar to the processing events observed for the turtle Pseudemys scripta, but distinct from the processing events observed in the squamate reptile A. carolinensis.},

	Abstract = {Aggressive interactions in Anolis carolinensis result in increased circulating levels of epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) and conspicuous color changes. This activation of the adrenergic component of an acute stress response is externally represented by the darkening of the postorbital eyespot of A. carolinensis. In adult males, this site darkens in response to stressful physical stimulation (trauma, passive restraint) or psychological stimuli, most notably the sight of an aggressively intruding conspecific. Aggressive male A. carolinensis exhibit postorbital eyespot darkening; animals that have a longer latency to expression of this eyespot and those that never show this response were defeated in agonistic interactions. Also, during agonistic interactions, subjects that subsequently win are the first to display eyespot darkening. Plasma catecholamine levels are significantly elevated within 30 sec in both combatants. At 30 sec following the determination of the outcome, winning male lizards have plasma NE levels which are higher than those of losers. Castration, however, significantly increases the latency to eyespot darkening and extends its duration. Testosterone levels may therefore enhance the onset of Epi-mediated eyespot darkening as well as other aspects of the endocrine stress response. Elevated androgen levels and more rapid activation of acute catecholamine response increases the likelihood of becoming socially dominant.},

@article{Wiechmann:1994aa,
	Abstract = {Melatonin binding sites were identified in the brain and retina of the lizard Anolis carolinensis using in vitro autoradiography. Radioactive labeling was observed in areas which receive primary, secondary, and tertiary visual input: the superficial layers of the optic tectum, lateral geniculate nucleus, nucleus rotundus, dorsal ventricular ridge, and striatum. Other areas that demonstrated binding included the left medial habenular nucleus, the interpeduncular nucleus, medial cortex, dorsal cortex, mammillary nucleus, and septum. In the retina, melatonin binding was localized in the inner plexiform layer. Radioactive melatonin binding to the optic tectum was reduced in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable cyclic GMP analog, indicating that the melatonin receptor in the brain of this lizard is associated with a G-protein. These results suggest that melatonin receptor binding sites are widely distributed in the forebrain and midbrain of the iguanid lizard, and are prominent in areas of the nervous system that are associated with visual processing. The highest degree of melatonin binding appeared in the left medial habenular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and dorsal ventricular ridge. This suggests that these brain regions may be important targets for the actions of melatonin, such as its effects on circadian rhythmicity, thermoregulation and photoperiodic reproduction.},

	Abstract = {Regenerating scales in lizards originate as pockets in the epidermis instead of epidermal elevations as during embryo development. The morphogenesis of scales in the regenerating tail of the lizards. Anolis and Lamphropholis was studied after peritoneal injection of 3H-thymidine. The tracer was localized in the forming epidermis after progressive post-injection times, by means of autoradiography on plastic sections. After 4-5 hours post-injection of 3H-thymidine, the radioactivity was localized in the basal layer. After 2 to 4 days post-injection labelled cells were seen in the basal and intermediate spinosus layers but not in the uppermost keratinizing layers. Labelled cells were seen in the differentiating cornifying layers (pre-beta and pre-alpha) 6-8 days post-injection. At 12-14 days post-injection almost no radioactivity was seen in the basal layer or in the living part of the epidermis. A few labelled cells were present in the dense keratinizing layers of the sloughing wound and interscale lacunar layers. This study shows that scale formation and morphogenesis in the regenerating tail is brought about by a localized cell proliferation along the regenerating epidermis. In the forming scales the percentage of labelled cells in the distal side (future dorsal part of the new scale) is much higher than in the proximal side (the future ventral side of the scale), so that overlapped scales are generated.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a mathematical model which allows us to compare the data collected from short-term cross-sectional surveys with the population dynamics of host and parasite populations over longer periods of time. The model extends an earlier framework for two parasite species in one host, to one for an arbitrary number of parasite species. We show that the conditions necessary for the coexistence of two parasite species extend to expressions for the coexistence of three or more parasite species. Furthermore, the model suggests that those species which form the 'core' of the parasite community are those whose high fecundity and transmission efficiency permit them to colonize hosts readily. In contrast, those species which are classified as 'satellite' species of the community are either species with low fecundity, or low transmission efficiencies. This work confirms earlier studies that suggest that increasing degrees of aggregation are crucial in allowing several species of parasites to coexist in the same species of hosts. The properties of the model are compared with patterns observed in data collected for helminth parasites of Anolis lizards, wood mice and eels. This combined theoretical and empirical approach confirms the importance of the life history strategies of the parasite in determining the abundance of each species in the community. It suggests that studies of parasite community structure have to pay more attention to the strategies pursued by each individual species before interactions between species are considered.},

@article{Sherry:1993aa,
	Abstract = {Golgi-impregnated amacrine cells in the all-cone lizard retina (Anolis carolinensis) were characterized on the bases of dendritic and somatic criteria. Four major cell categories, comprising 23 types were identified: three non-stratified, 13 monostratified, five bistratified, and two tristratified types. Four of the cell types comprised two to four subtypes based on stratification of their dendrites within the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Golgi impregnation strongly favoured monostratified amacrine cells with cell bodies at the proximal margin of the inner nuclear layer. The neurotransmitter content of each of the 23 amacrine cell types was examined by combined Golgi-immunocytochemistry after morphological classification. Putative neurotransmitters examined included gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine (GLY) and aspartate (ASP). Seventeen cell types showed GABA-immunoreactivity (IR), three cell types showed GLY-IR, and four cell types showed neither GABA-IR nor GLY-IR. No cell types showed ASP-IR. Each cell type had a characteristic neurochemical signature, with the exception of one monostratified cell type that showed three different neurochemical signatures. Postembedding immunocytochemistry on conventionally processed retinas confirmed the localization of glutamic acid decarboxylase, the synthetic enzyme for GABA, to cells similar to several of the GABA-IR Golgi-stained types. Postembedding immunocytochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (the synthetic enzyme for catecholamines) and GABA on serial sections demonstrated colocalization of GABA and a catecholamine, probably dopamine, in a bistratified amacrine cell type. We conclude that GABA-IR amacrine cell types are more numerous and morphologically heterogeneous than GLY-IR amacrine cells. The morphological heterogeneity and, with one exception, exclusivity of GABA-IR and GLY-IR amacrine cell types indicate that both neurotransmitters play a variety and different functional roles in the lizard inner retina.},

It is not known whether individual, physically isolated pineal cells are capable of generating a circadian oscillation in melatonin release. This question was addressed by utilizing a reverse hemolytic plaque assay for the detection of melatonin secretion from individual pineal cells. Dissociated pineal cells from the anole lizard, maintained in short term culture, displayed a marked variation in melatonin secretion for up to 72 h under both cyclic lighting conditions and in constant dark. The persistence of daily fluctuations of melatonin secretion from individual cells strongly suggests that individual pineal cells can function as circadian oscillators.},

	Abstract = {We describe a research protocol for evaluating temperature regulation from data on small field-active ectothermic animals, especially lizards. The protocol requires data on body temperatures (Tb) of field-active ectotherms, on available operative temperatures (Te, "null temperatures" for nonregulating animals), and on the thermoregulatory set-point range (preferred body temperatures, Tset). These data are used to estimate several quantitative indexes that collectively summarize temperature regulation: the "precision" of body temperature (variance in Tb, or an equivalent metric), the "accuracy" of body temperature relative to the set-point range (the average difference between Tb and Tset), and the "effectiveness" of thermoregulation (the extent to which body temperatures are closer on the average to the set-point range than are operative temperatures). If additional data on the thermal dependence of performance are available, the impact of thermoregulation on performance (the extent to which performance is enhanced relative to that of nonregulating animals) can also be estimated. A sample analysis of the thermal biology of three Anolis lizards in Puerto Rico demonstrates the utility of the new protocol and its superiority to previous methods of evaluating temperature regulation. We also discuss several ways in which the research protocol can be extended and applied to other organisms.},

Its retina is unusual for possessing two foveas (areas associated with heightened visual acuity), with the major, central fovea deeply incised and very densely packed with photoreceptors. Immunoblotting and light- and electron microscopic-immunocytochemistry, using several opsin monoclonal antibodies previously found specific for rods, demonstrated the presence and localization of this protein in the Anolis retina. This visual pigment appears sparsely in a subpopulation of photoreceptors in the periphery but overwhelmingly in the central fovea. Complementary results with cone-specific antibody and lectin binding corroborated this spatial organization. These results, as well as those with geckos, suggest that photoreceptor morphology is not an accurate guide among the lacertilians to visual pigment content, and that this phylogenetic grouping may constitute a crossroads in vertebrate photoreceptor evolution.},

	Abstract = {Preserved museum specimens of 13 lizard and 3 snake species common in the southeastern U.S.A. were examined for immature Ixodes scapularis Say ticks. Five Eumeces and 4 Ophisaurus lizard species yielded an infestation prevalence of 17.8% for species of Eumeces and 29.0% for species of Ophisaurus. Mean intensity of larvae and nymphs was 7.1 and 2.7, respectively, for species of Eumeces, and 6.3 and 1.4, respectively, for species of Ophisaurus. Collection dates of the lizards ranged from January through December, but most were collected from March through October. The maximum number of immatures found on a single specimen was 193 larvae and 11 nymphs on a specimen of Eumeces and 75 larvae and 7 nymphs on a specimen of Ophisaurus. For species of Eumeces, 75.2% of all nymphs observed were attached in the shoulder area. Larvae were most abundant on the rear legs (53.3%), followed by the front legs (26.3%) and shoulders (12.9%). Larvae and nymphs on species of Ophisaurus were found almost exclusively in the lateral groove area (84.0% and 94.4%, respectively). Three other lizard species (Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus undulatus, Scincella lateralis) had only a few ticks or none. A fourth species, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus, hosted a total of 3 larvae on 3 specimens (infestation prevalence, 10.7%). Three snake species (Diadophis punctatus, Virginia striatula, Crotalus adamanteus) had none.},

@article{Hyde:1993aa,
	Abstract = {Experiments were conducted to determine if a correlation exists between any aspect of the pineal melatonin rhythm (such as its duration or phase) in the lizard Anolis carolinensis and the reproductive response to photoperiod. The rhythm of pineal melatonin content was determined in anoles exposed to nightbreak lighting protocols (10L:5D:1L:8D, 10L:10D:1L:3D), resonance lighting cycles (LD 11:13, LD 11:25), and T-cycle lighting protocols (LD 11:7, LD 11:9, LD 11:13, LD 11:15, LD 11:19) and compared with the testicular response to these lighting protocols as determined previously [Underwood and Hyde, (1990) J. Comp. Physiol. (A) 167:231-243]. Different T-cycles and nightbreak cycles elicited changes in both the duration of the melatonin peak and the phase of the melatonin peak relative to these light cycles. The response to the resonance cycle (LD 11:25) was complex, probably due to the overlapping patterns of two groups whose pineal melatonin rhythms were entrained approximately 12 hr out of phase with each other. No correlation was observed between the duration, or the amplitude, of the nocturnal melatonin peaks seen on the various light cycles and the reproductive response to these cycles. A correlation was observed between the phase of the pineal melatonin rhythm and the reproductive response. Light cycles were inductive (stimulated testicular growth) when the entrained melatonin rhythm peaked near the light-to-dark or the dark-to-light transition, but they were not inductive when the melatonin rhythm peaked during the middle third of the night. These results suggest that if melatonin is involved in the transduction of photoperiodic information in Anolis, neither the duration nor amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin pulse is involved in the measurement of day length. Instead, the phase-relationship of the melatonin rhythm to the rest of the circadian system may determine photoperiodic responsiveness.},

	Abstract = {Fully terrestrial vertebrates were previously thought to exclusively employ vitamin A1 to generate visual pigments. However, recent studies on the visual system of the lizard Anolis carolinensis have shown that its visual pigments are vitamin A2-based. This unexpected result prompted an investigation of the pineal photopigments in this species [13]. HPLC analysis has shown that this extraretinal photoreceptor also exclusively utilizes a vitamin A2-derived chromophore. The adaptive significance of this chromophore within the pineal is unclear. The extended long wavelength sensitivity characteristic of vitamin A2-based visual pigment systems may enhance important visual tasks such as prey detection or mate selection [13]. A similar argument cannot be made for the pineal, whose role is not image formation, but rather detection of the irradiance changes associated with dawn and dusk. We suggest that the pineal may passively utilize whatever retinoids have been adaptively selected by the visual system.},

	Abstract = {The reliance on anaerobic metabolism during exercise in lizards has been the subject of a growing body of literature in activity metabolism. Prior studies have demonstrated that lizards rely more on postexercise lactate to regenerate depleted glycogen stores than do many mammals. These studies prompted an in vitro comparison between the metabolic mechanisms for the handling of lactate and glucose in the muscles of a small mammal and lizard. Hindlimb muscles of Mus and Anolis were stimulated to fatigue and then incubated in the presence of 15 mM lactate and either 5.5 (mice) or 8.5 (anoles) mM glucose. Oxidation rates of lactate and glucose were seven to eight times higher in mice. Both species oxidized more lactate than glucose (8 to 9 times). However, anole muscle showed a preference for lactate as a substrate for glycogenesis, incorporating 1.5 times as much lactate (expressed in glucose equivalents) as glucose. In contradistinction, mice incorporated 2.8 times as much glucose into glycogen as lactate. The quantitative differences in metabolic scope of mammals and reptiles are accompanied by fundamental differences in the capacity and patterns of skeletal muscle metabolism of lactate and glucose.},

	Abstract = {Tongue-flicking in reptiles is frequently seen to increase in novel habitats and is presumed to involve the acquisition of chemical information. Like most behavioral patterns, however, tongue-flicking has both multiple causes and multiple functions, only some of which involve chemosensation. This paper describes units of exploratory behavior, including use of the tongue, in a microsmatic lizard, the green anole, Anolis carolinensis. This species employs its tongue in a manner suggestive of chemosensory exploration, but it possesses modest peripheral chemosensory organs and reduced central representation of chemosensory target cell groups. Further, specific elements of exploratory behavior are affected differently by treatments that involve altering levels of stress-sensitive hormones, androgen, and central catecholamines. Such differential responses suggest that exploratory behavior is an ensemble of individual units, some of which are selectively sensitive to specific physiological elements of the stress response and of elevated arousal.},

	Abstract = {Crosslinking of MSH receptors on melanophores of the lizard Anolis carolinensis with analogues of alpha-MSH containing a photoreactive group in position 1, 7, 9 or 13 leads to long-lasting receptor stimulation. Reversibility of this long-lasting stimulation is obtained by employing a disulfide-containing photoreactive group which can be cleaved from the receptor by thiol reagents [Ref. 3]. When two photoreactive groups are simultaneously present on the alpha-MSH molecule (e.g in positions 1 + 9; 1 + 13; 7 + 13, or 9 + 13), identical results were obtained and long-lasting receptor stimulation was not altered after cleavage of one single crosslink. alpha-MSH analogues with three photoreactive groups in positions 1 + 7 + 13 led to irreversible receptor stimulation whereas one compound with the photoreactive groups in positions 1 + 9 + 13 induced reversible receptor inactivation which could be changed into long-lasting stimulation by cleaving the crosslink at position 1 of alpha-MSH. These results demonstrate that one and the same peptide ligand may contain structural information for both receptor activation and inhibition and that the receptor may become arrested in an activated or inhibited state by multiple photocrosslinking, depending on the relative positions of these crosslinks.},

	Abstract = {Thirteen lizards (Anolis carolinensis and Scincella lateralis) were injected with 3H-GABA (tritiated gamma-aminobutyric acid) in order to study its localization inside the regenerating tail spinal cord (SC) by means of light and electron microscopic autoradiography. One and three hours after intraperitoneal injection, the radioactivity was essentially localized in regenerating nerves and pale cells, mostly contacting the central canal of the SC as typical Cerebrospinal-Fluid-Contacting-Neurons (CSFCNs). A smaller number of pale cells did not take up 3H-GABA and some of them appeared to be degenerating. Weaker radioactivity in regenerating SC was observed 6 hours post injection. Among non neural tissues, cells of the regenerating blastema, of the meninges and capillaries surrounding the regenerating SC, showed lower 3H-GABA uptake. This indicates that a certain amount of injected 3H-GABA has been converted to other metabolites. No 3H-GABA uptake was detected 1 or 6 hours post injection in normal SC and brain both in grey and white matter. This research indicates that CSFCNs of the regenerating tail in lizards uptake the aminoacid GABA or derived aminoacids, suggesting these cells subserve a high metabolic activity and may be GABA-ergic},

	Abstract = {The electroretinogram (ERG) was recorded from free-moving Anolis lizards once per hour for 5 days. As in our previous work, the b-wave, but not the a-wave, showed a reliable circadian rhythm (CR) in amplitude, with an acrophase near projected noon. Both the a- and b-waves showed a CR in peak time (implicit time, or IT), with the a-wave IT being longest near midnight, and the b-wave IT at midday. Acrophases were shifted when animals were housed on a phase-shifted light-dark cycle. The ERG CR was unaffected by removal of the parietal organ, but it was virtually abolished by removal of the pineal gland, thus suggesting that pineal output (probably melatonin) modulates retinal responses.

	Abstract = {A combined Golgi-impregnation/immunocytochemistry procedure was developed to identify the endogenous neurotransmitter content of morphologically characterized neurons. Golgi-impregnated retinal amacrine cells in the lizard Anolis carolinensis were characterized morphologically in thick resin sections. Cells of interest were remounted, resectioned at 1 micron thickness and subjected to a postembedding immunofluorescence procedure to visualize the amino acid neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine. Double-labeled cells were identified by opaque Golgi deposits in the cytoplasm under bright-field illumination and nuclear immunofluorescence under ultraviolet illumination. Twenty-seven Golgi-impregnated amacrine cells, exhibiting morphological features of GABA-immunoreactive (GABA-IR) cells, were tested for GABA-IR; 21 showed double labeling. Glycine-IR amacrine cells also were identified using the Golgi/immunocytochemistry procedure. This double-labeling procedure allows rapid assessment of endogenous neurotransmitter content in large samples of morphologically characterized neurons.},

	Abstract = {Arginine vasotocin (AVT) is a neuropeptide involved in reproductive function in many nonmammalian vertebrates. We determined brain and plasma AVT concentrations during the estrous cycle and oviposition in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. There were no differences in AVT concentrations in the plasma or any brain region during the ovipositional sequence. However, we found that females with an egg in each oviduct and a large pre-ovulatory follicle (diameter > 4.5 mm) in one-ovary had significantly higher AVT concentrations in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus than did females with small pre-ovulatory follicles in both ovaries. In a second study, females with an egg in each oviduct and a large pre-ovulatory follicle had significantly greater AVT concentrations in the SON than females with only one oviductal egg and a large pre-ovulatory follicle or females with an egg in each oviduct and a small pre-ovulatory follicle in each ovary. Concentrations of AVT in other brain regions and in the plasma did not differ among these groups. Changes in steroid profiles during estrous and/or direct neural communication between the uterus, ovary, and brain may account for the changes in AVT concentrations seen in the supraoptic nucleus during the estrous cycle of Anolis carolinensis.},

Unexpectedly, only vitamin A2-derived chromophore was detected in Anolis, while a mixture of vitamin A1- and vitamin A2-derived chromophores was detected in Podarcis. These are the first examples of fully terrestrial vertebrates using vitamin A2-derived chromophore for visual pigment generation.

Major catecholaminergic fibers, tracts and varicosities included tuberohypophysial, mesolimbic, nigrostriatal, isthmocortical, medullohypothalamic, and coeruleospinal systems. Although the catecholaminergic systems in A. carolinensis are similar to those in the brains of other lizards studied, there are a few species differences.

An analysis of melatonin receptor distribution in the lizard brain revealed an asymmetry of melatonin binding in the diencephalon. A high degree of melatonin binding was present in the left habenular nucleus, but no binding was observed in the habenulum of the right brain hemisphere. It is intriguing that the left habenular nucleus, in contrast to the right habenulum, both possesses a high density of melatonin receptors and receives primary photic input from the parietal eye. Similarly, the optic tectum, which receives primary visual input from the retina, is also rich in melatonin receptors. These observations suggest that the left habenulum is under dual control (neuronal and hormonal) of the parietal eye/pineal complex, and that melatonin may play a significant role in neural processing of visual information.},

	Abstract = {Immunocytochemical and autoradiographic methods were used to identify neurons in the pure cone retina of the lizard (Anolis carolinensis) that are likely to employ glutamate (GLU) or aspartate (ASP) as a neurotransmitter. GLU immunocytochemistry demonstrated high levels of endogenous GLU in all cone types and numerous bipolar cells. Moderate GLU levels were found in horizontal and ganglion cells. Muller cells and most amacrine cells had very low GLU levels. GLU immunoreactivity (GLU-IR) in the cones was present from the inner segment to the synaptic pedicle. A large spherical cell type with moderate GLU-IR was identified in the proximal inner plexiform layer (IPL). These cells also contain ASP and have been tentatively identified as amacrine cells. Uptake of [3H]-L-GLU labeled all retinal layers. All cone types and Muller cells sequestered [3H]-D-ASP, a substrate specific for the GLU transporter. Anti-ASP labeling was observed in cones, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and cells in the ganglion cell layer. ASP immunoreactivity (ASP-IR) in the cones was confined to the inner segment. One ASP-containing pyriform amacrine cell subtype ramifying in IPL sublamina b was identified. Analysis of GLU-IR, ASP-IR, and GABA-IR on serial sections indicated that there were two distinct populations of horizontal cells in the Anolis retina: one containing GABA-IR, GLU-IR, and ASP-IR; and another type containing only GLU-IR and ASP-IR. Light GLU-IR was frequently found in GABA-containing amacrine cells but ASP-IR was not. The distinct distributions of GLU and ASP may indicate distinctly different roles for these amino acids. GLU, not ASP, is probably the major neurotransmitter in the cone-bipolar-ganglion cell pathway of the Anolis retina. Both GLU and ASP are present in horizontal cells and specific subpopulations of amacrine cells, but it is unclear if GLU or ASP have a neurotransmitter role in these cells.},

Concurrently, it has recently been shown that injection of TRH induces skin darkening in the lizard Anolis carolinensis (Licht and Denver, 1988). In the present study, we have thus investigated in vitro the possible effect of TRH on alpha-MSH release from the lizard (Lacerta vivipara) neurointermediate lobe, by means of the perifusion technique. Using our radioimmunoassay procedure, we found that serial dilutions of L. vivipara NIL extracts and synthetic alpha-MSH gave parallel binding curves. Administration of graded doses of TRH (10(-8)-10(-6) M) did not cause any modification of alpha-MSH release. In contrast, infusion of a depolarizing concentration of K+ induced a robust stimulation of alpha-MSH secretion. These results indicate that, in the lizard L. vivipara, the neuropeptide TRH does not stimulate pituitary melanotrophs.},

Inhabiting all study plots, often in local abundance, L. trinidadensis emerged as the principal candidate sand fly vector; the results of surveys did not suggest a likely mosquito vector. Although L. trinidadensis and infected anoles co-inhabited all plots, their abundances seemed unrelated. No evidence that sand flies parasitized anoles was uncovered. As anole activity patterns in daylight reciprocate with those of sand flies and at night anoles seem to avoid locations that sand flies frequent, anoles may evade sand fly bites altogether. Further, these sand flies occurred in close numerical and ecological association with Thecadactylus rapicauda, a reclusive moist forest gecko, often parasitizing these hosts in large numbers. Thus, sand flies lack capacity as vectors of malaria-causing parasites in central Panamanian anoles.},

	Abstract = {The inhibitory amino-acid neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), was localized in the pure cone retina of the lizard Anolis carolinensis by autoradiographic and immunocytochemical techniques. Uptake of [3H]-GABA labeled horizontal cells, amacrine cells, numerous cells in the ganglion cell layer, both plexiform layers, and the nerve fiber layer. Label in the inner plexiform layer showed distinct lamination. The pattern of GABA immunoreactivity was similar to the pattern of [3H]-GABA uptake, although some differences, particularly in labeling of amacrine and ganglion cells, were observed. Immunocytochemistry revealed endogenous stores of GABA in a set of horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and cells in the ganglion cell layer. Both plexiform layers were labeled by the GABA antisera. Labeling in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) was highly stratified and GABA-immunoreactive strata were present in both sublaminae a and b. Six subtypes of conventionally placed GABA-immunoreactive amacrine cells and one displaced amacrine cell subtype were identified. Three of the six conventional amacrine cell subtypes were of pyriform morphology and three subtypes were of multipolar morphology. GABA-immunoreactive interstitial cells also were observed. Under certain conditions the GABA antiserum labeled the cones. Etching the resin eliminated cone labeling, suggesting that GABA in the cones is present in a labile pool, unlike GABA in horizontal or amacrine cells, or the observed labeling was not due to endogenous GABA. Cones did not demonstrate [3H]-GABA uptake.},

Methanol/acid extracts of whole brains obtained from each species were separately fractionated by gel filtration chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC. In all three species, an immunoreactive form of alpha-neo-endorphin was detected with the same retention time as synthetic mammalian alpha-neo-endorphin following reversed-phase HPLC analysis. In all three species, reversed-phase HPLC analysis revealed a novel form of dynorphin B(1-13)-related immunoreactivity. With the available immunological probes, dynorphin A products were only detected in the Anolis brain extracts. Both dynorphin A(1-17) and dynorphin A(1-8) were detected in this species.},

	Abstract = {We determined levels of monoamines and their metabolites in 2 hypothalami dissected from the right and left hemibrains of 15 females during the right-left alternating ovulatory cycle of Anolis carolinensis. Tissue contents of the following were measured using HPLC and electrochemical (coulometric) detection: dopamine (DA) and its metabolite 2,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolites 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), and serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). An asymmetry ratio (AR) was determined by subtracting hypothalamic content (pM/mg) on the larger ovary (LO) side from that on the smaller ovary (SO) side, divided by the sum of the 2 sides (AR = SO - LO/SO+LO). The Ar of MHPG and DHPG both decreased as the largest follicle in the LO grew during the cycle, from greater than 0 (content higher on the SO side) at the beginning of the cycle to less than 0 (content higher on the LO side). The average content of MHPG in the 2 sides significantly increased during the cycle. There were no significant asymmetric changes in hypothalamic DA or DOPAC. The average content of DA increased during the cycle, whereas the content of DOPAC, as well as DOPAC/DA, did not change. The average content of 5-HT increased, and the average metabolite ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT decreased during the cycle without significant asymmetries. The metabolite ratios of NE and DA, but not 5-HT, were asymmetric on the same side in a given female.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The lizard Anolis carolinensis exhibits asymmetric ovarian growth. At any given time, the larger ovary (LO) contains a larger follicle than does the smaller ovary (SO). Physiologically hypophysectomized females with quiescent ovaries were treated with gonadotropin (ovine FSH) or saline vehicle after either surgical removal of the LO or sham operation. The smaller ovaries of initial control, sham-operated, and hemiovariectomized (HO) females were similar in weight and follicular size. Therefore, endogenous gonadotropin secretion remained at subthreshold levels during the experiment and after HO. FSH significantly stimulated ovarian follicular growth in both sham-operated and HO females. However, the response of the SO of HO females to FSH was significantly greater than that in sham-operated females. These results demonstrate a greater sensitivity of the SO to FSH if the LO is absent.},

	Abstract = {Two species of sand flies were collected by various methods from sites in the Dominican Republic. Lutzomyia cayennensis hispaniolae was the more common of the two. It was found in wooded habitats from sea level to an elevation of 442 m. This species was observed feeding on lizards (Anolis sp.) in the wild. In the laboratory, it fed only on lizards and only under lighted conditions. The other species, Lu. christophei was only found in the vicinity of seven leishmaniasis case sites. It readily fed on or probed rodents and humans. Although no naturally infected sand flies were collected, in the laboratory Lu. christophei was readily capable of transmitting the Dominican Leishmania parasite to uninfected BALB/c mice. We collected 167 specimens of three species of rodents and three Herpestes auropunctatus (mongoose) from the vicinity of two case sites. All four species are non-endemics introduced in post-Columbian times. Although we were unable to isolate parasites from any of these specimens, four of 44 Rattus rattus from one case site were seropositive for antibodies against Leishmania by indirect fluorescent antibody testing. This represents the first report of transmission of the Dominican Leishmania parasite by a sympatric species of sand fly and suggests that commensal rodents may play a role in the epidemiologic cycle.},

Incubation of the retina in N2 medium with hyaluronidase and DNAase allows us to obtain intact photoreceptors with good purity (85-90%), yields (greater than 2 x 10(5) cells per retina), and more than 95% of them excluding Trypan blue. cAMP levels are 20-fold higher than cGMP levels in cells from dark-adapted animals and are decreased by 35% upon exposure to light, whereas cGMP levels show no apparent change. However, both cAMP- and cGMP-phosphodiesterases, as well as adenylate and guanylate cyclase, are activated several-fold by light, but the enzymes involved in cGMP metabolism have higher Vmaxs than the cAMP related enzymes. The apparent constant levels of cGMP found in cone photoreceptors may result from our inability to detect the very fast changes that occur in these cells when they are exposed to light.},

	Abstract = {H3-thymidine was injected in a single dose into adult lizards Anolis carolinensis during early stages of tail regeneration when the new tail measured in length 2-5 mm (about 3 weeks). Electron microscopic autoradiography revealed that in the regenerating spinal cord three different cell types were recognizable four hours post-injection. By far the most common type was the ependymal cell. Ependymal or roundish cells with clear electron-density or storing bundles of intermediate filaments were occasionally found. A second rarer, cell type devoid of intermediate filaments was a pale round cell, often highly labelled. This cell showed a very poor ultrastructural differentiation and probably represents the precursor of the few neurons and glial cells observed in older stages of regeneration. The third type was a neuroblast at different degrees of differentiation and did not uptake H3-thymidine revealing it was a post-mitotic cell. Despite the relatively advanced ultrastructural differentiation of these neurons, synapses were rarely seen after three weeks of SC regeneration in Anolis.},

Dewlap extension is accomplished by the contraction of ceratohyoid muscles associated with the hyoid apparatus. Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to investigate the brainstem origins of efferent fibers to the ceratohyoid muscles in Anolis equestris. Following application of HRP to the ceratohyoid muscle or to its nerve supply on one side of the throat, large polygonal motoneurons were found ipsilaterally in the vagal (Amb X) and glossopharyngeal (Amb IX) parts of nucleus ambiguus. Labelled neurons were more abundant and more heavily labelled in Amb X than in Amb IX. In addition, small spindle-shaped cells were labelled ipsilaterally in three parasympathetic nuclei that innervate glandular structures in the pharyngeal floor. HRP injections of the larynx labelled cells in many of the same locations, including Amb X and Amb IX. Thus, the nucleus ambiguus in Anolis contains motoneurons for supply of striated muscles in the hyoid (i.e. ceratohyoid muscles) and the larynx.},

Tryptic peptide analysis indicated that the [3H]Trp-labeled C-terminal fragment of Anolis alpha-MSH had the same retention time as mammalian ACTH(9-13) amide; however, the [3H]Tyr-labeled N-terminal fragment did not coelute with either mammalian ACTH(1-8) or N-acetyl-ACTH(1-8). Purification of alpha-MSH from 76 Anolis intermediate pituitaries confirmed that a sequence change had occurred in the N-terminal region of Anolis alpha-MSH. The tissues were acid extracted and purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography and reverse phase HPLC to yield 4.5 micrograms of purified Anolis alpha-MSH for amino acid composition analysis and automated Edman degradation sequence analysis. The major form of Anolis alpha-MSH is nonacetylated and has the following novel primary sequence: Ser-Tyr-Ala-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro(Val-amide).

	Abstract = {Vitellogenin (VTG) synthesis has been described as an ideal system to study the hormonal regulation of gene expression. In Xenopus the molecular aspects of this control have been analyzed; however, in other non-mammalian species such as reptiles, very few studies approaching this level have been undertaken. We report on the induction by estradiol-17 beta of VTG-like proteins in liver explants from adult males and immature male and female lizards (A. pulchellus). A concentration of 10(-7) M was optimum for adult males while a higher concentration (10(-6) M) is required for the immature animals. No differences were observed in the hormonal induction in male and female immature animals, suggesting that there are no sexual distinctions in the liver at this stage. The effect of the hormone in male liver appears to be primarily on mRNA synthesis, since increases in 3H-uridine incorporation in total RNA were prevented by addition of 1 microgram/ml of the RNA polymerase II inhibitor alpha-Amanitin; however, rRNA synthesis was also increased as observed by agarose gel analysis. A 48 hr lag period was required for the detection of the intracellular as well as the secreted VTG-like protein. Electrophoretical analysis of the secretory products revealed the induction of a group of phosphoproteins immunologically related to yolk lipovitellin whose molecular weights range from 116,000 to 200,000.},

@article{Grace:1991aa,
	Abstract = {Deacetylation is a rapid clearance mechanism for ocular melatonin. We have studied the distribution of retinal melatonin deacetylase activity among vertebrate classes. Exogenous radiolabeled melatonin is metabolized by ocular tissue prepared from the amphibian Xenopus laevis, the reptile Anolis carolinensis, the teleost fish Carassius auratus, and the bird Gallus domesticus. In contrast, we were unable to detect ocular melatonin breakdown in rat or pig. In each species exhibiting ocular melatonin breakdown, melatonin is first deacetylated to 5-methoxytryptamine, which is deaminated, producing 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol. Deacetylation of melatonin is inhibited by eserine (physostigmine), causing a reduction in the levels of all 3 metabolites. Deamination of 5-methoxytryptamine is inhibited by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline, such that 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol levels are decreased while levels of 5-methoxytryptamine are increased. Incubation with the deacetylase inhibitor eserine increases endogenous melatonin levels in Xenopus and Carassius eyecups, indicating that endogenous melatonin is metabolized via the deacetylase. We also studied the tissue distribution of the deacetylase in Xenopus laevis. Melatonin deacetylation occurs in retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and skin, all of which are sites of melatonin action. These results indicate that among non-mammalian vertebrates, deacetylation is a common clearance mechanism for ocular melatonin, and may degrade melatonin at other sites of action as well. Melatonin deacetylation may help regulate local melatonin concentration, and generates other biologically active methoxyindoles.},

However, mortalities and morbidity were high in the Culex which had fed on the Coluber. Oocysts were not found in any Ornithodoros turicata (Argasidae) which fed upon either snake host, but many sections of fed ticks had gametocyte-like cells within the gut lumen. Most lizards, Anolis carolinensis and Anolis sagrei, infected per os with oocysts derived from both snake species developed infections. Infections in the lizards were largely confined to hepatic schizonts with few parasites found in erythrocytes. Unlike naturally infected snake hosts, Hepatozoon schizonts in livers of lizards were often either surrounded by an unidentified dark pigment or heavily infiltrated with mononuclear inflammatory cells.},

	Abstract = {Cone and rod photoreceptors utilize cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the light regulation of membrane polarization. The prototype for visual transduction is established for rod photoreceptors, which utilize a cascade of reactions to regulate a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) (EC 3.1.4.17) and thereby control the intracellular concentration of cGMP. Although cones appear to utilize a comparable cGMP cascade for their phototransduction, evidence exists that the PDE from cone photoreceptors may be different from that of rods. Dissociated cone photoreceptors, isolated retinas, and cone outer segments from the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, have been used to identify and characterize a PDE enzyme complex that shares several features in common with the rod outer segment (ROS) PDE complex. Immunoadsorption and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have identified a subunit of lizard cone PDE that has an apparent electrophoretic mobility of 84 kDa and a subunit of lizard rod PDE that migrates at approximately 90 kDa. The lizard cone PDE complex is similar in size, extraction, activation, and immunological characteristics to the PDE complex of rod photoreceptors from lizard, bovine, and human retinas. The lizard cone PDE complex, and perhaps that from cone photoreceptors in general, differs from that of ROS in its chromatographic properties on anion-exchange resins. The sharing of physical and activation properties of the rod and cone PDE complex is compatible with the phototransduction process occurring by a similar mechanism in both cell types. The differences in light sensitivity and speed of response may be attributable to features of the individual proteins that form the PDE complexes of rods and cones or to other undisclosed features of the respective cascades.},

	Abstract = {Proximate constraints on egg size, number, and total clutch mass in side-blotched lizards were examined by experimentally reducing average clutch size from 4.6 eggs to one, two, and three eggs. Eggs from experimentally altered clutches were larger than those from controls, reflecting the trade-off between egg size and number. Moreover, the increased frequency of females with oviducally bound eggs or eggs that burst at oviposition suggests that egg size in clutches with very few eggs are at a functional upper size limit. These proximate constraints may also limit evolution of egg size in another group of lizards (Anolis) that only produces one-egged clutches.},

	Abstract = {That portion of the dorsal surface of the tongue of Anolis carolinensis that is covered by plumose papillae is underlaid by a series of tubular salivary glands that open between the papillae; glands persist into the posterior zone of the tongue, where they open between cylindriform papillae. Anterior glands are serous in nature--they consist of simple columnar epithelial cells that contain abundant secretory granules exhibiting a variety of substructural patterns. The Golgi apparatus is large and of unusual appearance, with numerous closely packed terminal dilatations and condensing vacuoles. Near the posterior border of the lingual zone covered by plumose papillae, mucous cells begin to appear in the glandular epithelium. More posteriorly, the apical portions of the glands consist entirely of mucous cells, whereas the blind ends of the glands are composed of serous cells. The most posterior glands are of the pure mucous variety. The glands finally disappear a short distance posterior to the cylindriform papillae. The functions of the abundant and highly differentiated salivary glands of the Anolis tongue remain obscure.},

	Abstract = {1. Three size-classes of vitellogenin polypeptides were detected by electrophoretic and radiolabeling techniques in 32Pi-labeled plasma of vitellogenic female lizards but not in male animals. Based on their apparent Mr, the polypeptides were designated as VTG-226-201K, VTG-169-153K and VTG-116-123K. 2. Structural differences were found between VTG-169-153K and VTG-116K by partial proteolysis with S. aureus V8 protease and radiolabeling techniques. 3. Autoradiography of a 3-10% native gradient gel revealed three different species of VTG in 32Pi-labeled plasma of stimulated males: VTG-I (Mr = 850,000), VTG-II (Mr = 750,000) and VTG-III (Mr = 610,000). By 2D PAGE, it was shown that VTG-169K and VTG-116K are components of VTG-I, while VTG-153K and VTG-116K comprise VTG-III. These results suggest an oligomeric structure for native VTG. 4. Amino acid analysis, 32Pi incorporation, electrophoretical behavior and Mr estimation demonstrated homology between VTG-116K and the S1-lipovitellin from the lizard egg. 5. These results strongly indicate an unusual multiplicity of VTG forms in tropical lizards when compared to other egg-laying vertebrates.},

The imaging system consisted of a Sarastro Phoibos 1000 (Molecular Dynamics) scanning system and a Zeiss Universal microscope. The data were analyzed using the VANIS set of programs on a Silicon Graphics Personal Iris computer. A three dimensional reconstruction of the nerve terminals was performed using look-through and depth-coded projections. The volume of the nerve terminal was estimated in 15 neuromuscular junctions and found to be 84,835 microns 3 (+/- 8558 SEM). The largest diameter in each one of the 178 individual boutons was estimated from the look-through projections of 17 nerve terminals in 9 preparations. It was found to be 4.71 microns (+/- 0.08 SEM). The diameter perpendicular to the largest diameter in the same projection at 0 degrees was 3.3 microns (+/- 0.054 SEM). Thus it seems that the synaptic boutons of the ceratomandibularis are suitable for combined optical and electrophysiological recordings.},

	Abstract = {Three different monoiodinated radioligands of alpha-MSH (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) were compared in a binding assay with human D10 melanoma cells: [Tyr(125I)2]-alpha-MSH, [Tyr(125I)2,NIe4]-alpha-MSH, and [Tyr(125I)2,NIe4,D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH. They were prepared either by the classical chloramine T method or by the Enzymobead method. A simple and rapid purification scheme was developed consisting of a primary separation on reversed-phase C18 silica cartridges immediately after the iodination, followed by HPLC purification before each binding experiment. Biological testing of the three radioligands showed that they all retained high melanotropic activity in the B16 melanin assay and the Anolis melanophore assay. However, in human D10 melanoma cells, [Tyr(125I)2,NIe4]-alpha-MSH led to a high degree of non-specific binding to the cells which could not be displaced by excess alpha-MSH and only partially by [NIe4]-alpha-MSH. The [Tyr(125I)2,NIe4,D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH tracer gave similar results but with a much lower proportion of non-specific binding. On the other hand, [Tyr(125I)2]-alpha-MSH proved to be an excellent radioligand whose non-specific binding to the D10 cells was not higher than 20% of the total binding.},

	Abstract = {The dewlap is an extendible flap of skin ordinarily folded under the throat. Lizards, particularly those in the genus Anolis, extend their dewlaps during interactions with conspecifics, other lizards, and potential predators. Dewlap extension is effected by movements of elements of the hyoid apparatus. This paper describes the anatomy of the hyoid and associated musculature in Anolis equestris, a large arboreal lizard with a prominent dewlap. A mechanism for dewlap extension is proposed based on results of morphological and experimental techniques. Specializations of the hyoid skeleton for dewlap extension include elongated second ceratobranchials and highly movable joints between the ceratohyals and the hypohyals and between the first ceratobranchials and the body of the hyoid. A well developed M. ceratohyoideus extends between the ceratohyals and the first ceratobranchials of the hyoid apparatus. During dewlap extension, the hyoid apparatus acts as a first order lever. Contraction of M. ceratohyoideus pulls the ceratohyals posteriorly causing the hypohyals and the body of the hyoid to rotate dorsally around the first ceratobranchial/body joints. This movement results in the second ceratobranchials swinging forward and down, unfolding the dewlap. The relative immobility of the first ceratobranchials provides stability to the hyoid apparatus during dewlap extension. A comparison is made of dewlap extension and other hyoid displays.},

Radiommunoassay of 0.1 N HCl extracts of Chrysemys bladder indicated an immunoreactive NT (iNT) concentration of 161 +/- 39 pmol/g tissue (n = 9), an amount lower but comparable in magnitude to that found in mucosal scrapings of the intestine (926 +/- 125 pmol/g, n = 9). Bladder and intestinal iNT were indistinguishable during chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and HPLC on mu-Bondapak C18 where they eluted at the same position as avian NT. Similar results were obtained by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay of urinary bladders from Pseudemys scripta scripta, P. scripta elegans, and P. floridana, three emydid species closely related to C. picta, but not from Sternotherus odoratus and Trionyx spinifer asper, representatives of the families Kinosternidae and Trionychidae, respectively, although positive results were obtained with intestinal preparations from these species. NT cells were not seen in urinary bladder from Rana pipiens, Bufo marinus, Necturus maculosus, or Anolis carolinensis. Thus, the presence of NT-containing cells in urinary bladder is not common among subavian vertebrates and may even be restricted to the Emydidae family of chelonians.},

	Abstract = {Adult males of the small arboreal iguanid lizard, Anolis carolinensis, will fight and form social dominance hierarchies when placed in habitats with limited resources. The relationships between time since initial aggressive interaction, relative social dominance, reproductive activity, and corticosterone and androgen levels were determined for 34 pairs of lizards. A discriminant analysis established a "dominance index" which indicated that over 90% of the difference between individuals who had won or lost aggressive interactions (putative social dominants and subordinates) was attributable to a single discriminant function reflecting altered body color, perch site selection, and circulating androgen. Animals that had darker body color also selected lower perch sites and had depressed rates of courtship relative to winners of fights and were thus designated as social subordinates. These animals also had levels of circulating androgen significantly lower than that of dominants, but circulating corticosterone was not significantly affected. Winners of fights showed a dramatic surge in circulating androgen at 1 hr but returned to near control values by 1 week; losers, however, showed depressed circulating androgen levels at 1 week.},

To test the possible role of hypothalamic function in ovarian asymmetry, we measured levels of 3 major monoamine neurotransmitters (norepinephrine; dopamine; serotonin) and their metabolites in microdissected left and right diencephalon from lizards during the first cycle of ovulation in the spring. All of the metabolite/parent neurotransmitter ratios were significantly higher on the side of the diencephalon ipsilateral to the quiescent ovary than on the side of the maturing ovary. Simultaneous ovarian and brain asymmetry suggests direct communication between the ovary and brain, presumably through the ovarian innervation.},

	Abstract = {Over 90{\%} of the Sertoli cells in the testes of adult lizards (Anolis carolinensis) are binucleate. The nuclei occur in closely associated pairs in the basal cytoplasm of the Sertoli cells that line the testis tubules. The two nuclei of a pair are of similar volume, and each usually contains one conspicuous rounded nucleolus. The average volume of individual nuclei varies from 367.8 microm(3) in spermatogenically active testes in March to 172.5 microm(3) in September, when testes are regressed. The irregular shape of the Sertoli nuclei is particularly pronounced during testicular regression. Until initiation of spermatogenesis in hatchling lizards, Sertoli cells have a single nucleus containing patches of hetcrochromatin. With the appearance of prophase stages of primary spermatocytes, a few paired Sertoli nuclei can be found, and the nuclei increasingly exhibit the homogeneous euchromatic nucleoplasm of the adult. The average volume of individual nuclei in lizards under 4 months of age is less than a third the volume of Sertoli nuclei in reproductively active adults. The appearance of binucleate cells at this time documents a doubling of the amount of desoxynucleic acid in Sertoli cells preparatory to their growth and expanded functions during spermatogenesis.},

Control measurements for mild laboratory manipulation (such as the movement of a metabolic chamber) yielded significant increases in the rate of oxygen consumption, but not in the lactate concentration of these animals; stronger manipulation increased both. A possible influence of conspecific olfactory cues on the metabolism of lizards introduced into empty chambers was undetected. Anolis that turned from green to brown with handling showed an increase in oxygen uptake, but an association between this color shift and total body lactate level was not detected. Elevated rates of oxygen use and glycolysis were found in pairs of males in the absence of physical activity. Lactate levels of the individuals of a pair were positively correlated with one another; the lactate concentrations of lizards placed into occupied metabolic chambers were correlated with the difference in body mass of the pair.},

	Abstract = {Utilizing results from previous structure-activity relationships and theoretical studies of alpha-melanotropin (alpha-MSH, Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2) and its related superpotent analogues, Ac-[Nle4,D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH and Ac-[Cys4,Cys10]-alpha-MSH, we have designed a new class of alpha-MSH4-13 and alpha-MSH4-10 cyclic lactam fragment analogues of alpha-melanotropin. The cyclic peptides have the following general structures: Ac-[Nle4,Xxx5,D-Phe7,Yyy10,Gly11]-alpha-MSH4-13- NH2 and Ac-[Nle4,Xxx5,D-Phe7,Yyy10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2, where Xxx = Glu or Asp and Yyy = Lys, Orn, Dab, or Dpr. Formation of the lactam bridge between the side-chain groups Xxx and Yyy was performed either in solution or on a solid-phase support. Seven cyclic peptides were prepared and bioassayed for their melanotropic potency by using standard frog (Rana pipiens) and lizard (Anolis carolinensis) skin bioassays. Relative to alpha-MSH (relative potency = 1), the potencies of the cyclic peptides in the lizard skin bioassay were as follows: alpha-MSH (1); Ac-[Nle4,Glu5,D-Phe7,Lys10,Gly11]-alpha-MSH4-13- NH2 (6); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Lys10,Gly11]-alpha-MSH4-13- NH2 (100); Ac-[Nle4,Glu5,D-Phe7,Lys10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (9); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Lys10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (90); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Orn10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (20); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Dab10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (5); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Dpr10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (5). Similar results were obtained in the frog skin bioassay, but the analogues were much less potent. Cyclic melanotropins with 23-membered rings exhibited 100-fold higher melanotropic potency than alpha-MSH with selectivity for the lizard melanocyte receptors over the frog melanocyte receptors. Increasing or decreasing the ring size of these cyclic melanotropins from 23 diminishes the biological potency of the resulting cyclic peptide. The 23- and 24-membered ring analogues showed prolonged (residual) biological activities in both biological assays, but the smaller ring systems (20, 21, 22) did not. These results provide new insights into the structural and conformational requirements of alpha-MSH and its analogues at two different types of pigment cell (melanocyte) receptors.},

Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry using immunogold and avidin/biotin-peroxidase techniques showed that 20 93 antigen is localized to the paraboloid, a region specifically involved in glycogen metabolism in cones. In addition, a few bipolar cells were found to be labeled. The monoclonal antibody showed limited species cross-reactivity and failed to stain mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cow, Anolis, and human retinas. Immunoblotting showed that monoclonal antibody 20-93 binds to a 40 KDa protein that is present in the retinal membrane.

They revealed that while Na+ channels are the major ionic current pathway in the heminode, K+ channels provide the major pathway in the terminal branches and boutons. 3. Calcium current in the presynaptic ending was unmasked by the application of tetraethylammonium (TEA). This current was blocked by: (a) cadmium, (b) omega-conotoxin GVIA and (c) nifedipine, but was unaffected by nickel at concentrations less than or equal to 100 microM. Nifedipine's action became more definitive when the duration of the action potential was greatly extended by pre-treatment with TEA. The effect of Bay K 8644 was inconsistent. 4. Transmitter release, as measured by postsynaptic current, had a pharmacological response profile similar to that of the Ca2+ current, with the exception that transmitter release was increased reliably and reversibly by Bay K 8644. 5. This pharmacological response profile is identical to that of the L type Ca2+ channel identified by Fox, Nowycky & Tsien (1987 alpha) in chick dorsal root ganglion neurones. We saw no evidence for more than a single type of Ca2+ channel in lizard motor nerve endings. 6. A calcium-activated K+ current IK(Ca) was revealed by application of 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP), a delayed-rectifier K+ channel blocker. This K(Ca) current was blocked by TEA, charybdotoxin and by substitution of cobalt for extracellular calcium.},

	Abstract = {Saurian malaria parasites in the Caribbean were previously represented by only two species, Plasmodium azurophilum and P. floridense. An additional three species of Plasmodium occur on Hispaniola which appear, because of morphometric and qualitative similarities, to be related to South and Middle American species: a subspecies of Plasmodium tropiduri in Anolis cybotes; a population of Plasmodium minasense anolisi in A. cybotes and A. distichus; and another parasite in A. distichus which is designated as a subspecies of a previously undescribed Plasmodium species in Anolis limifrons. Taxonomic descriptions based upon morphology of mature schizonts and gametocytes are given, the previously unknown parasites are described as new species/subspecies, and comparison is made with P. floridense which also occurs in their respective host species. A Fallisia species was also present but is not described. The increased diversity of Plasmodium parasites in Hispaniolan anoles is attributed to colonization of the island by four separate evolutionary lines of Anolis lizards, in comparison to fewer invasions of Jamaica and Puerto Rico, where only P. floridense and P. azurophilum are found.},

The minimal sequence of alpha-MSH required for agonism in the lizard (Anolis carolinensis) skin bioassay was determined to be Ac-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2 (Ac-alpha-MSH6-9-NH2). Smaller fragments of this sequence (Ac-alpha-MSH6-8-NH2, Ac-alpha-MSH6-7-NH2, Ac-alpha-MSH7-9-NH2, and Ac-alpha-MSH7-8-NH2) were devoid of melanotropic activity. The tetrapeptide, Ac-alpha-MSH7-10-NH2, was also inactive, thus again demonstrating the importance of His at position 6 for minimal activity. The important potentiating amino acids were found to be Met-4, Lys-11, and Pro-12, since Ac-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 was about 100 times more potent than Ac-alpha-MSH5-10-NH2, and Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 was about 40 times more potent than Ac-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 or Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2. Ac-alpha-MSH4-12-NH2 and Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-12-NH2 were equipotent and about six times more potent than alpha-MSH. Since [Nle4]-alpha-MSH and Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-13-NH2 were both equipotent but about sixfold less active than Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-12-NH2, it is clear that valine at position 13 does not contribute to the potency of alpha-MSH, except possibly in a negative way. The minimal message sequence for equipotency to alpha-MSH appears to be Ac-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-NH2, since the analog, Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2, was as active as the native hormone. Ser-1, Tyr-2, Ser-3, Glu-5, and Val-13 are not important for melanotropic potency since Ac-alpha-MSH4-12-NH2 was more potent than alpha-MSH, and Ac-alpha-MSH5-10-NH2 and Ac-alpha-MSH6-10-NH2 were equipotent, being about 4,000 times less active than alpha-MSH.},

	Abstract = {alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is a linear tridecapeptide (Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2) that has diverse physiological functions in addition to its reversible darkening of amphibian skins by stimulating melanosome dispersion within melanophores. On the basis of theoretical and experimental results from our laboratory and others, we have designed a group of 1-13, 4-13, and especially 4-10 analogues related to the superpotent analogue [Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH in which the Glu5 has been replaced with Asp5, and the Gly10 has been replaced with Lys10 and other basic amino acid residues in the 4-10 analogues, and in which Gly10 and Lys11 were interchanged in the longer peptide analogues. In the 1-13 and 4-13 series the Lys10, Gly11 analogues generally retained superpotency for the D-Phe7-containing analogues. Most interestingly, synthesis of Ac-[Nle4,Xxx5,Yyy7,Zzz10]alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 analogues where Xxx = Asp or Glu, Yyy = Phe or D-Phe, and Zzz = basic amino acids (Lys, Orn, alpha,gamma-diaminobutyric acid (Dab), and alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (Dpr] provided melanotropins with potencies up to 10 times that of the native hormone in stimulating frog (Rana pipiens) skin darkening and 8-50 times more potent than alpha-MSH in stimulating lizard (Anolis carolinensis) skin melanophores in vitro. To our knowledge, Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Dab10]alpha-MSH4-10-NH2, the most potent analogue, is the most potent melanotropin obtained thus far for the Anolis assay system. These results provide new insights into the structural and conformational requirements for biological potency of alpha-MSH and the differential structural and conformational requirements of alpha-MSH and its analogues at two different types of pigment cell receptors.},

	Abstract = {Although much is known about morphological changes in the apex of the mammalian ovarian follicle prior to its rupture (ovulation), information about this process in nonmammalian vertebrates is limited to only a few species. We describe here the histological changes in the stigma of the lizard (Anolis carolinensis) ovarian follicle preceding FSH-induced ovulation. Females with a large vitellogenic follicle received two injections, separated by 7 hr, of either porcine FSH (25 micrograms) or saline, and then were sampled at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 hr after the first injection. Thus, all but the 6-hr group received two injections. By 12 hr, about half of the FSH-treated females had ovulated, and most had ovulated by 15 hr. In contrast, only 1 of 40 control females ovulated. Large unovulated follicles were fixed and bisected through the circular stigma; one hemisphere was embedded in paraffin and stained with Mallory's trichrome, and the other was embedded in plastic and stained with toluidine blue. FSH treatment produced marked histological changes in the stigma region, as well as alterations in nonstigmal areas of the follicle. The membrana granulosa of control follicles consisted of a single layer of squamous, darkly staining granulosa cells. After FSH treatment, nonstigmal granulosa cells separated slightly, and their nuclei became more clear and assumed an oval shape; in the stigma, these cells became widely separated, with round, light-staining nuclei containing one or two prominent nucleoli. The nonstigmal theca of FSH-treated follicles was similar to that of control follicles except that collagen fibers were more dissociated. In the stigma, collagen fibers were widely dissociated, and the theca swelled, presumably due to accumulation of extracellular fluid. Abundant fluid accumulated in the stigma, especially between the granulosa cells and their basement membrane and between the tunica albuginea and the theca externa. These changes in the lizard stigma are similar to those reported in mammals except that no marked inflammatory response occurs in the lizard stigma. We hypothesize that the Anolis follicle undergoes preovulatory luteinization, and that the stigma exhibits ischemic necrosis before rupture.},

The melanotropin activities of these two analogues were examined and compared relative to those of alpha-MSH, Ac-[Nle4]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2, and Ac-[Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2. In the frog (Rana pipiens) skin bioassay, the L-Phe7 17-membered ring cyclic analogue was slightly more potent than the linear Ac-[Nle4]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 and exhibited prolonged melanotropic bioactivity (greater than or equal to 4 h). In this same assay, the D-Phe7 cyclic analogue was more than 100-fold less potent than the L-Phe cyclic analogue and was 10,000 times less potent than linear Ac-[Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2. In the lizard skin (Anolis carolinensis) bioassay, the L-Phe7 cyclic analogue was 100-fold less potent than Ac-[Nle4]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2, while the D-Phe7 cyclic analogue was 10,000-fold less potent than both Ac-[Nle4]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 and the D-Phe7 linear derivative Ac-[Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2. The solution conformation of these two cyclic analogues in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 was examined by 1D and 2D 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Our analysis suggests an H bond stabilized C10 (or C13) turn for the D-Phe7 cyclic structure while the L-Phe7 analogue is more conformationally flexible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The ability of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) to stimulate thyrotropin (TSH) from pituitaries of adult male lizards, Anolis carolinensis, was tested in vivo and in vitro. TSH output by pituitaries in vitro was determined by bioassay of the incubation medium using in vitro T4 output by thyroids from the same lizards. Pituitaries incubated without TRH had no detectable TSH secretion during two consecutive (2 or 3 hr) periods of incubation. Incubation in 10 or 100 ng/ml TRH for 2 or 3 hr significantly augmented release of TSH bioactivity in a dose-dependent manner. Pituitaries taken from goitrogen (100 micrograms methimazole/day for 10 days)-treated lizards had elevated basal TSH secretion but did not respond to TRH. TRH injection in vivo (5 micrograms/hr for 10 hr) appeared to stimulate acute release of MSH activity as judged by darkening of skin color after each injection, and plasma T4 was significantly elevated at the end of treatment. These results provide additional evidence that the reptilian thyrotrope has functional TRH receptors and the TSH-stimulating activity of the tripeptide along with its effects on other pituitary cells was present at an early stage of reptilian evolution.},

Cell lines tested for tumor production were also assessed for loss of attachment-dependent proliferation and contact inhibition of cell overlap. The results demonstrate that the criteria standardly used to assess transformation and neoplastic change in cultured mammalian cells apply equally well to cultured cells from ectotherms.},

	Abstract = {We examined dynamical factors that shape the distribution of the number of parasites/host in constant or temporally varying environments, and with or without host-age dependent variation in host susceptibility and parasite mortality. We predict properties of the parasite distribution in the absence of density-dependent factors such as density-dependent mortality of recruitment and parasite-induced host mortality. These properties provide a criterion for the detection of density dependence in temporally variable systems with host-age dependent interactions. We have then introduced methods to estimate and statistically evaluate the effects of host age or size on the distribution of parasites/host. The methods are based on a maximum likelihood protocol for linear and non-linear regression when data are negatively binomially distributed. We have illustrated the use of the theoretical results and statistical methods by re-analysing the data of Halvorsen & Andersen (1984) on cestode infections in Norwegian arctic charr and by analysing new data on nematode infections in Caribbean Anolis lizards.},
