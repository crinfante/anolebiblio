@article{Logan:1981aa,
	Abstract = {Melanotrophin-potentiating factor (MPF) is a fragment of human beta-lipotrophin (LPH 88-91) which potentiates the action of alpha-MSH on Anolis skin. In the present study, we investigated the effect of MPF on MSH-induced melanogenesis. Pooled hair follicle scrapings from Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) were incubated for 48 hours with or without alpha-MSH and/or MPF. Melanogenesis was monitored by measuring tyrosinase activity and melanin accumulation. 10-8 M MPF potentiated the effect of no effect on melanogenesis, but 10-9 to 10-7 M alpha-MSH caused a dose-related increase. 10-8 M MPF potentiated the effect of each dose of alpha-MSH. Thus MPF potentiated MSH action on mammalian melanogenesis as well as on reptilian melanosome dispersion. Although each of these processes involve different intracellular responses the receptor mechanisms involved in each may therefore be the same.},

@article{Laughran:1981aa,
	Abstract = {Two types of filaments (microfilaments 4--6 nm in diameter, and intermediate filaments 7--10 nm in diameter) are common in the surface epithelial cells and theca fibroblasts of vitellogenic ovarian follicles of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. Heavy meromyosin (HMM), which forms complexes with actin filaments, interacts only with the microfilaments of theca fibroblasts. After myosin extraction of follicles no filaments disappeared, but when this treatment was followed by incubation with deoxyribonuclease I (DNA-ase I), which depolymerizes F-actin to G-actin, microfilaments disappeared from the theca fibroblasts. It is concluded that microfilaments in theca fibroblasts are actin-like and may contract to provide the mechanism of expulsion for the oocyte during ovulation. The intermediate filaments of the surface epithelial cells and theca fibroblasts may serve as a skeletal system for the large (up to 8 mm in diameter) vitellogenic follicle.},

@article{Larsson:1981aa,
	Abstract = {The distribution of the tracer substance horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Mw 40,000) in the neuro-intermediate lobe of the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, was studied at various time intervals (13 min to 24 h) after vascular injection. HRP rapidly entered the extracellular lumen of the neural lobe, but did not penetrate into the third ventricle. The tracer was found in micropinocytotic vesicles (MPVs) of ependymal cells within 13 min after injection. The number of cellular inclusions containing HRP increased during the period of observation (24h). The tracer was sparsely taken up by aminergic and peptidergic nerve terminals of the external layer. After transection of the hypophysial stalk, numerous dense, labelled droplets were found in the peptidergic terminals, and the number of labelled inclusions in ependymal cells increased. MPVs were frequently found in extensions of stellate cells of the intermediate lobe, and endocytotic vacuoles (EVs) developed especially in the perikaryon. HRP was also found in large cisternae of the secretory cells, appearing predominantly towards the perivascular septum (PVS). These cisternae were found to communicate with the extracellular lumen, probably representing a system of the extracellular space extending into the secretory cell. After transection of the hypophysial stalk, there was an increase in the number of small EVs in secretory cells of the intermediate lobe. The results are discussed in terms of MSH-release regulation and possible participation of the extracellular lumen, glial and stellate cells in the transport of regulating factors and secretory material.},

@article{Cashner:1981aa,
	Abstract = {In June, 36 lizards (males and females) were injected with 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, or 100 mg/kg of MIF-I, or the diluent vehicle, and placed in a cage for ten minutes. Tonic immobility (TI) was then induced on an open lab table. All doses of MIF-I significantly reduced TI duration as compared to the duration with the diluent alone. In subsequent experiments lizards were injected with 0.1 mg/kg of MIF-I, 0.1 mg/kg of naloxone, or the diluent vehicle, and placed in small aquaria for ten minutes. TI was then induced in the small aquaria. In July, using 60 females, MIF-I and naloxone slightly reduced the duration of TI, but not significantly, and overall TI durations were reduced as compared with the first experiment possibly because the lizards could escape from the view of the experimenter in the corners of the aquaria. A third experiment was done in late September and early October with 120 males and 120 females. No drug effect was seen, but there was a significant difference between the TI durations of males and females, the females having longer durations. A relationship between the difference in response to MIF-I and the breeding seasons of the lizards could not be determined due to the possibility that the change in experimental design after the June experiments may alone have accounted for the loss of the significant response to MIF-I.},

	Abstract = {The electron microscopic localization of insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) in the pancreas of the iguanid lizard, Anolis carolinensis was studied by the unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunocytochemical technique. Insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin were localized absolutely to those cells previously identified on the basis of the characteristics of their secretory granules as being beta cells, alpha cells, and D cells, respectively. The secretory granule cores of the PP-containing cells appeared to be ellipsoidal with a semi-major axis of 450 nm and a semi-minor axis of 365 nm. This previously unidentified cell type is named the F cell, in keeping with the localization of PP to the original F cell of the canine pancreas. Without immunocytochemical staining, the qualitative ultrastructural characteristics of the F cell secretory granules were inadequate to permit identification of the F cell, especially with regard to the D cell.},

The dimensions of the junctions, as characterized by the distance between opposite extremities of the arciform membrane appositions, averaged 0.14, 0.19, and 0.28 microgram, respectively, on noncalyceal utricular and saccular hair cells, and calyceal cells of the utricular striola.

	Abstract = {Both luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) induce sexual receptivity in ovariectomized, estrogen-primed female lizards (Anolis carolinensis). Ovariectomized females pretreated with three daily injections of a subthreshold dose (0.2 micrograms) of estradiol benzoate were administered either 500, 1,000 or 1,500 ng of LHRH, or 1,000 ng of TRH 48 h following the last estrogen pretreatment injection. Hormone-treated females exhibited significantly higher sexual receptivity scores than controls when tested 2, 4, 6 and 24 h post-injection. Female sexual receptivity scores in females that were administered 500 ng of LHRH or 1,000 ng of deamido TRH were, however, no different than control scores at these test times. The observed ability of LHRH to increase female sexual receptivity is consistent with previous results in birds and mammals. The ability of TRH to increase female sexual receptivity is a novel finding that may underscore differences in neuroendocrine regulation of vertebrate estrous behavior.},

	Abstract = {Immunocharacteristics of the pars distalis cells of the pituitary of the male lizard A. carolinensis are determined by employing the immunoperoxidase technique with antisera to mammalian pituitary hormones. On the basis of their immunoreactivity, 5 different cell types with characteristic anatomical distribution are recognized. ACTH cells are found in the rostral half of the pars distalis, and PRL cells in the rostral two thirds of the pars distalis. GH and TSH cells are located in the caudal half of the pars distalis. GTH cells are distributed throughout the gland. When consecutive sections are stained with antiserum to ovine FSH or its beta-subunit and to ovine LH, the same cells show immunoreactivity to all the three antisera. None of the GTH cells show positive immunoreactivity to ovine beta-LH antiserum. The results suggest the existence of one gonadotropic cell type in the pituitary of this lizard.},

	Abstract = {The presence and the neuroanatomical topography of sex hormone concentrating cells in the brain of the American chameleon, Anolis carolinensis have been demonstrated by these experiments. After 3H-estradiol administration large numbers of hormone concentrating cells were found in the amygdala, septum, medial preoptic area, anterior hypothalamic area, the ventromedial and periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, and anterior pituitary. In addition, labelled cells were found in the torus semicircularis, in and around the nucleus isthmus pars parvocellularis. A small number of labelled cells could also be found in the rostral pallium, motor nucleus of the fifth cranial nerve, the raphe nuclei, and the spinal cord. After 3H-testosterone or 3H-dihydrotestosterone administration the neuroanatomical pattern was very similar to that found after 3H-estradiol; however, fewer labelled cells were seen after the androgens were given. Two exceptions to the similarity of pattern were in a caudal part of the pallium and in the mesencephalic tegmental area. Hormone-concentrating cells were found after 3H-testosterone or 3H-dihydrotestosterone administration, while labelled cells in these two areas after 3H-estradiol administration were extremely rare. The pattern of hormone-concentrating cells was the same in male and female brains, for each of the hormones. The preoptic area, hypothalamus, and anterior pituitary have been demonstrated in reptiles to be involved in neuroendocrine regulation and in the control of sex behaviors. The presence and neuroanatomical pattern of sex steroid binding cells in the brains of a wide variety of vertebrates have been documented. Large numbers of hormone-concentrating cells were found in all of these species in the medial preoptic area, tuberal hypothalamus, specific limbic structures, the mesencephalon deep to the tectum, and the anterior pituitary. Most hormone-concentrating cells in the brain of A. carolinensis were found in these same brain regions, thus indicating a vertebrate-wide stable core of hormone-concentrating cells in neuroanatomically defined regions.},

Responses to a conspecific male antagonist in a territorial confrontation were then tested when the subject's vision was limited to an eye leading to either the normal or lesioned hemisphere. In lizards with lesions involving the paleostriatum and lateral forebrain bundle, there was an elimination of or marked deficit in the performance of the challenge display while signature displays and measures of general activity were not significantly affected. Lesions predominantly in anterior or posterior dorsal ventricular ridge resulted in no significant deficit in any behavioral measure.},

Two types of synaptic endings are endings are present on motor neurons. The first type is characterized by distinct synaptic clefts measuring 15-20 nm between pre- and postsynaptic membranes, and by clear presynaptic vesicles. The second type of synapse, which is less common, is characterized by gap junctions between pre- and postsynaptic membranes. At these synapses, there are also clusters of clear vesicles close to the presynaptic membrane adjacent to the gap junction.

@article{Shivers:1979aa,
	Abstract = {The anatomical basis of the blood-brain barrier in the American chameleon, Anolis carolinensis, is the system of tight intercellular junctions that occurs between apposed endothelial cells of brain capillaries. Under normal physiological conditions, capillaries in the brain cortex of these animals remain sealed by interendothelial zonulae occludentes and, consequently, escape of exogenous tracer proteins such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the extracellular compartment of the central nervous system is prevented. Systemic injection of 2.7 mg of D-glucose into chameleons results in increased brain capillary permeability, as evidenced by escape of HRP or Trypan blue into the intercellular spaces of central neuropil. Freeze-fracture analysis of brain capillary endothelia of glucose-hyperglycemic lizards revealed no alteration of the ridge and groove construction of endothelial tight junctions, indicating that although the blood-brain interface becomes leaky during severe hyperglycemia, the capillary zonulae occludentes are not affected. Evidence obtained in this study strongly supports the notion that the increased capillary permeability is the result of amplified transendothelial transport. The effect is manifest as and facilitated by the formation of chains of pinocytotic vesicles derived from the luminal surface of the endothelial cells, which fuse to create open trans-endothelial conduits. It is likely that formation of open channels that traverse brain capillary endothelial cells, as a response to hyperglycemia, could allow temporarily unrestricted passage of a wide range of molecules, some potentially toxic, into the CNS extracellular milieu. This is the first report to unequivocally document with freeze-cleave techniques, that abnormally elevated levels of blood sugar can affect blood-brain interface permeability. This finding suggests that similar consequences may be expected to result from diabetic hyperglycemia in humans.},

	Abstract = {An electron microscopic examination of the parietal retinas of Anolis carolinensis and Iguana iguana demonstrated within each retina (1) two distinct populations of neurons, (2) two populations of glia, and (3) a population of photoreceptors which could not be subdivided. A small population of very electron-dense cells, in many respects similar to photoreceptors, was also found in the iguana. Correspondingly dark processes were found in the plexiform layer of each retina. Parietal photoreceptors generally resemble cones of the lateral eye. Glial cells were sub-classified on the basis of the location of their somata and the disposition of their processes. Neurons were identified by virtue of their cytology and their reception of axosomatic ribbon synapses from unidentified plexiform layer processes. Neuronal subtypes were located on opposite sides of the plexiform layer. Neurons distal to that layer were found to project the initial segments of their processes into the plexiform layer parallel to its long axis, while neurons central to the plexiform layer projected axons centrally and dendrites radially into the plexiform layer. The existence of at least two neuronal populations and of interphotoreceptor synapses suggests that photosensory processing within the parietal retina may be more complex than previously assumed.},

	Abstract = {Morphological changes in the disconnected neuro-intermediate lobe were studied in the lizard, Anolis carolinensis from the 2nd to the 14th post-operative day using a threefold aldehyde fixative (Rodriguez, 1969). Two phases of colour change capacity were exhibited: Phase I started immediately after the transection, lasted for 6 days (mean) and was characterised by an excessive MSH release (brown skin). This phase proceeded gradually into Phase II, designated by an interruption by the MSH release (green skin). The degenerative processes and final elimination of neurons in the disconnected neural lobe propagate in a rostro-caudal direction from the transected area. The aminergic fibres (Type II) disappear within 2 days postoperatively, whereas the degeneration continues for more than 10 days in the peptidergic fibres (Type III, IV and V). The glia cells (ependyma and pituicytes) serve as very active macrophages, engulfing fragments of axons already affected by autolysis and transferring them into glial lysosomes. No apparent morphological changes occur in the shift from Phase I to II. The great majority of the secretory cells of the intermediate lobe are not affected by degenerative processes and appear to be markedly activated by the stalk transection. They exhibit numerous mitochondria, well-developed Golgi complexes forming numerous Golgi vesicles and extensive parallel cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, sometimes forming large intracisternal droplets (7 micron in diameter). Numerous pale vacuoles are seen, especially toward the intact capillaries, suggesting their coupling to the MSH release by extension of the active membrane area toward the perivascular septum. The number of these vacuoles is very markedly reduced in Phase II (no release), whereas the formation of new granules seems to proceed in early stages. The interruption of the MSH release implies a successive refilling of gradually growing secretory granules and a concomitant reduction in the development of the synthetic apparatus. Mechanisms probably involved in the control of the synthesis and release of MSH are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The ultrastructure of the intermediate lobe of the hypophysis was studied in Anolis carolinensis with the use of a threefold aldehyde fixative. Lizards with a brown skin were selected. The possibility of two types of secretory cells is discussed; neither cell type is innervated. Type I cells are rarely found and contain dense granules approximately 0.3 micron in diameter; Type II cells vary widely in secretory activity. Most of the Type II cells contain a large number of dense secretory granules (up to about 1.3 micron in diameter) almost filling the cytoplasm. Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi apparatus and mitochondria are poorly developed. Only some of these cells show signs suggesting a high secretory activity, namely a well developed RER, Golgi apparatus and numerous mitochondria. In these cells the RER sometimes forms large intracisternal droplets (up to 7 micron in diameter). Two of the animals exhibited a more uniform, high secretory activity. Large (about 2 micron in diameter), pale vacuoles, probably of extracellular character, were found mostly in the vicinity of the perivascular septum. Their role in the release of MSH is discussed. The present data, which are discussed with reference to earlier findings (Forbes, 1972), form the morphological basis for an experimental study on regulation of MSH release (Larsson et al., 1979).},

	Abstract = {The junctional complexes of the myelin sheath of central nervous system axons in the American chameleon, Anolis carolinensis, exhibit an intramembrane ridge and groove construction in freeze-fracture replicas that has usually been interpreted in other organisms as evidence for an occluding or tight intercellular junction. Close examination of PF fracture face ridges, however, shows them to be made up of discontinuous rows of particles of variable length separated by frequent gaps of non-uniform width. Introduction of horseradish peroxidase into the intercellular milieu of the lizard central nervous system is followed by appearance of this protein in interlamellar spaces of the myelin sheath and in the intercellular spaces containing focal membrane fusions that correspond precisely in position and center-to-center spacing to the ridges and grooves in platinum replicas of the same tissue. Since the junctional ridges on PF fracture faces in these mesaxonal junctional complexes are conspicuously discontinuous and since the areas within the myelin sheath where these junctional complexes are located inner and outer mesaxons) are readily permeated by exogenous protein tracer, it is concluded that the junctional complexes of central myelin mesaxons, heretofore incorrectly interpreted as functionally tight, are actually very leaky and probably contribute only to the structural stability of the myelin sheath architecture.},

	Abstract = {The androgen aromatization hypothesis was examined in the male lizard, Anolis carolinensis. After castration, sc silastic implants of testosterone (T) restored both challenge and courtship behavior, while dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or 17beta-estradiol (E) had no effect on male behaviors. Both T and DHT, but not E, stimulated hypertrophy and colloid production by the renal sex segment, a secondary sexual characteristic of male lizards. In two separate studies, castrates received DHT in combination with E. In each replicate, half of the castrates responded with increases in courtship behavior after hormone treatment. Epithelial cell height of the sex segment of all DHT and E-treated castrates was comparable to T- or DHT-treated castrates, but colloid production was not stimulated. These experiments indicate that in this species, treatment with T stimulates both sexual behavior and secondary sex character development, whereas treatment with E alone is without effect centrally or peripherally.},

	Abstract = {An accurate, highly reproducible and sensitive bioassay for melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) using the skin of Anolis carolinensis in vitro is described. The time taken for green Anolis skin fragments to change to a specific, visually assessed, green-brown color is dose-related, and this forms the basis of the new assay. The method is simple to perform, and 1 person may assay 20 samples in a day using the dorsal skin from a single adult lizard. The mean dose-response ranges between 48 X 10(-12) and 375 X 12(-12) M (38 to 625 pg/ml). Using the assay, alpha-MSH, beta-MSH, ACTH (4-10), and ACTH (1-10) were equipotent on a molar basis. For repeated bioassay of rat pituitary extracts, the dose-response curves were highly significant, and only 1 of the 9 pituitary dose-response curves deviated significantly from the slope of the standard alpha-MSH curve. The index of precision, lambda, for the 9 pituitary bioassays ranged between 0.037 and 0.081, while the mean 95% fiducial limits were -6.6 and 7.1% on either side of the estimated potency. The new rate method is compared with an earlier quantal method which also uses the isolated skin of Anolis carolinensis. The quantal method does not have dose-response characteristics and is therefore less accurate and reproducible than the new method; the coefficient of variation for repeated bioassay of the same pituitary extracts ranged from between 12 to 20% for the quantal method and between 2.9 to 5.7% for the new rate method.},

	Abstract = {Scanning and transmission electron microscopy have been used to investigate the structure of the papilla neglecta in the lizard, Anolis carolinensis. Situated in the posterior part of the utricle, the receptor is innervated by a branch of the posterior ampullary nerve and is covered by an extracellular membrane that exhibits a tapering extension into the orifice of the utriculo-saccular duct. The neuroepithelium contains two populations of sensory cells within a matrix of sustentacular cells; one population (non-calyceal hair cells) is supplied primarily by boutons and clublike terminals, while the other (calyceal hair cells) is served by calycine terminals that invest from one to five sensory cells. The apices of calyceal hair cells bulge into the utricular lumen and have larger diameters and ciliary counts than non-calyceal cells, but other differences are not marked. Although the bases of calyceal hair cells are deeply indented by calyceal processes, both types show similar afferent synaptic structures confined to the nuclear and infranuclear regions. Efferent terminals synapse on afferent endings and hair cells in both cases; synapses directly on calyceal hair cells lie above the calyx, just beneath the apicolateral junctional complexes. Those complexes are basically similar throughout the receptor, except that a hemispheroidal gap junction between a supporting cell and adjacent hair cell was noted in several instances. Arrays of endoplasmic reticulum and specialized mitochondria occur adjacent to aggregations of afferent synaptic vesicles in both types of sensory cell; it is suggested that such arrays may participate in the production of the vesicles in a process involving membrane recycling similar to that at the neuromuscular junction. Differences between calycine units and the type I hair cell of mammals are discussed, and evidence that suggests an equilibratory function for the lacertilian papilla neglecta is presented.},

	Abstract = {We have compared the melanophore-stimulating action of four phenothiazines, trifluoperazine, perphenazine, chlorpromazine, and prochlorperazine, with alpha-MSH on the skin of the lizard Anolis carolinensis, using a new rate method of bioassay. The dose-response curves for the phenothiazines were parallel to that of alpha-MSH, and when given together alpha-MSH and chlorpromazine were additive. The phenothiazines may therefore stimulate melanosome dispersion in the lizard skin by the same mechanism as alpha-MSH; a MSH-mimetic action of phenothiazines may similarly explain their pigmentary action in man. The pigmentary potency of the phenothiazines corresponded with their therapeutic potency in man; this is in keeping with a neuro-regulatory role for MSH peptides and suggests a possible therapeutic use for them.},

	Abstract = {The ultrastructure of the neural lobe of the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, was studied after fixation in a threefold aldehyde solution. The neural lobe appeared as narrow vertical diverticula separated from one another and from the pars intermedia by a continuous vascular septum. No nerves passed through this septum. The ependymal, fibrous and external layers were readily recognized. Peptidergic fibres were the main component of the fibrous layer. The peptidergic endings were in intimate contact with the ependymal cells, suggesting that the ependyma mediates the release of neural lobe peptides. The external layer contained ependymal end-feet and numerous aminergic terminals, ending directly on the perivascular basal lamina and/or on the ependymal end-feet. The functional aspects are discussed in terms of intermediate lobe control. The findings suggest that aminergic substances take part in the control of the intermedia, but do not exclude the involvement of peptide hormones.},

	Abstract = {The neurointermediate lobes of dark-adapted toads Xenopus laevis were incubated for 30 min in [3H]arginine and then "chased" for various time periods. By use of this pulse-chase paradigm there were detected 10 trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable peptides separated on acid-urea polyacrylamide gels and one TCA-soluble peptide separated by high-voltage electrophoresis (pH 4.9) with melanotropic activity. Each of these peptides had a different degree of melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) activity as revealed by the Anolis skin bioassay. Three of these TCA-precipitable peptides comigrated with ACTH, beta-lipotrophin, and alpha-MSH on acid-urea gels. Evidence suggesting a precursor-product mode of biosynthesis of the melanotropic peptides is presented. 7 of the 10 TCA-precipitable peptides and the one TCA-soluble peptide with melanotropic activity were released into the medium. The half-time of release of the TCA-precipitable peptides was about 2 h, whereas the half-time of TCA-soluble peptide release was about 30 min. The release of these peptides was inhibited by 5 X 10(-5) M dopamine. Dopamine inhibition of release did not appear to affect the biosynthesis of the melanotropic peptides, but did appear to enhance the degradation of the newly synthesized TCA-soluble peptide in the tissue. White adaptation of the toads greatly decreased the biosynthesis of all of the TCA-precipitable melanotropic peptides.},

In Experiment 1 lizards received 14 daily injections of either saline, clomiphene (1, 10 or 20 mcg), or FSH (1 or 10 mcg) or combined clomiphene-FSH treatment. In Experiment 2, adult lizards with hypertrophied, vitellogenic ovaries, and enlarged oviducts, weres adenohypophysectomized and treated with a daily dose of .05 ml of either saline, saline plus 5 mcg clomiphene, saline plus 10 mcg FSH, saline plus 10 mcg estradiol-17beta, or FSH plus clomiphene or estradiol plus clomiphene. FSH increased follicle size in previtellogenic ovaries. Injection of 1 mcg clomiphene reduces the effects of FSH. 20 mcg clomiphene given alone stimulated the growth of larger follicles. Clomiphene blocked FSH-induced appearance or maintenance of large (less than 2.0 mm) vitellogenic follicles. It blocked FSH gains in oviductal weight and well as stimulated growth of small previtellic follicles. Estradiol-induced follicular and oviductal growth was uneffected by clomiphene. While low doses of clomiphene are antiestrogenic they are unable to combat the effects of high dose estradiol.},

	Abstract = {Thermal behavior of parietalectomized, sham-parietalectomized or intact lizards (Anolis carolinensis) was recorded in a test chamber containing moving photothermal gradients. Following parietalectomy, animals chose significantly higher temperatures than sham-parietalectomized or intact control animals, which chose lower and statistically identical temperatures. When pre-surgical and post-surgical means are compared within groups, the eccritic temperature was 2.10 degrees C higher following parietalectomy, 0.72 degrees C higher following sham-parietalectomy, and 0.31 degrees C higher in intact controls during the post-operative measurements. The effects of parietalectomy indicate that the parietalpineal complex may be involved in behavioral thermoregulation by precisely regulating exposure to heat sources (e.g. sunlight).},

Host blood pictures, parasitemia, parasite structure, infection states, and host population dynamics are correlated. Local epidemics occur, but in contrast to temperate zone species there is little regional synchronization. Active infections occur year-around, being somewhat more common in dry seasons; however, chronic infections predominate. Mature schizonts have 3 to 14, usually 6, 8, or 10 merozoites, reduced to 4 to 6 in chronic infections. Gametocytes are round to oblong, measuring 6 by 5 mu, and the pigment in microgametocytes occurs in a single peripheral vacuole. Parasitemia averaged 2.5% and seldom surpassed 20 to 30%. Infections cause significant anemia, and parasites in active infections are most common in immature erythrocytes. Host response is similar to avian or primate infections, including erythropoiesis, phagocytosis, and interference with parasite growth.},

Histamine causes vasodilatation of thecal vessels. Antihistamine blocks the effects of histamine and, when given alone, stimulates vasoconstriction. Antihistamine also blocks estradiol-induced growth of large follicles. These findings are consistent with the above hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {A simple and rapid assay for the quantitative determination of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) activity, using skin fragments of the lizard Anolis carolinensis in vitro, is described in detail. This assay, in which a quantal response (e.g. induction of a brownish-green colour) can be detected by visual observation, allows determination of MSH activity in up to 50 samples/day by one person, using the skin of one lizard. The mean dose found to induce this colour change was 0-15 ng synthetic alpha-MSH/ml (range 0-02-0-5 ng/ml). The assays shows high accuracy, reproducibility and specificity. Anterior and posterior lobe hormones as well as pituitary catecholamines do not interfere with the determination of pituitary MSH activitymthe method is compared with the assay using hypophysectomized frogs (Rana pipiens) in vivo. Determinations of MSH in pituitary extracts by both methods gave quantitatively similar results when determined with alpha-MSH as the reference substance. However, when beta-seryl MSH was used as a reference, the two assays gave different results for the MSH activity of the pituitary extractsmthis indicates that MSH from the rat pituitary gland has a biological activity similar to that of alpha-MSH rather than to that of beta-seryl MSH.},

M. ulcerans was recovered in culture from the slowly progressive lesions which developed at the inoculation site in lizards receiving the viable bacteria. Progressive lesions did not occur in the two control groups. Three patterns of inflammatory response to viable M. ulcerans were observed: 14 lizards developed a diffuse, granulomatous reaction in which acid fast bacilli (AFB) were predominantly intracellular; 1 developed focal, encapsulated granulomas; 5 developed a diffuse, necrotizing granulomatous response in which most AFB were extracellular--similar to the characteristic lesion found in human infections.},

	Abstract = {Resting pituitary melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) content was studied in adult rats kept under a controlled 14 h light-10 h dark regimen. A diurnal rhythm was found in pituitary MSH levels, showing peak values at 4.00-6.00 p.m., and low values during darkness and the beginning of the light period. The normally occurring fall in pituitary MSH content between 6.00 p.m. and midnight was also found in rats exposed to a prolonged photoperiod. Sympathetic denervation of the pineal gland by superior cervical ganglionectomy, as well as pinealectomy, did not block the rhythm in pituitary MSH, and had no effect on pituitary MSH content. In addition, melatonin administered i.v. did not affect pituitary MSH levels, either when MSH activity was tested on the Anolis skin in vitro, or when the in vivo assay with hypophysectomized frogs (Rana pipiens) was used. It was concluded that the diurnal rhythm in pituitary MSH content is not directly related to the light-dark cycle and is not controlled by pineal melatonin or any otherpineal factor.},

	Abstract = {The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of lizard (Anolis carolinensis) myocardial cells has been examined, with particular attention being paid to the structural details of the peripheral couplings (junctional SR). Spheroidal bodies are present within the opaque core of junctional SR; these can be seen both in sections made en face and in sections cut to show the apposition of the junctional SR with the sarcolemma. Opaque junctional processes extend between the sarcolemma and the peripheral junctional SR. The myocardial cells in addition contain some SR cisternae deep within the cells which also possess opaque cores composed of spheroids. Although the significance of the junctional SR spheroidal bodies is unknown, it is thought that they could act as a matrix on which enzymes such as calcium-specific ATPase may be located.},

New fine-structural details are revealed, and their importance is discussed. Of some interest is the complex of filaments between crystalline sheets in the cell. It is proposed that this complex is involved in the arrangement of crystals into crystalline sheets, and that the crystal arrangement and spacing are critical for the production of the cells' blue-green color. Tyndall scattering and thin-film interference are discussed as possible explanations for iridophore color production in relation to the fine-structural data obtained.},

Only the median eye lens exhibited fluorescence specific for the crystallins; other structures were negative. These results indicate that the lens of the reptilean median eye shares tissue-specific antigenic determinants with the lens of the lateral eye. This suggests a possible evolutionary relation between the two structures, based on biochemical, as well as previously reported anatomical, criteria.},

The response to this hormone is directly related to the concentration of the Ca(2+) ion. Lithium, choline, rubidium, and cesium will replace the sodium and potassium of Ringer solution if Ca(2+) is present. Calcium ions are not required for melanosome dispersion itself, since theophylline or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate reversibly darkens lizard skins in the absence of calcium.},

@article{Goldman:1970aa,
	Abstract = {1. Skins of the lizard Anolis carolinensis darken in vitro in response to melanophore stimulating hormone (MSH), a peptide hormone, as well as to catecholamines. These hormones darken Anolis skins by dispersing the sub-cellular organelle, the melanosome, out into the dendritic processes of the dermal melanophores.2. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and methylxanthines also darken skins. In addition, methylxanthines are synergistic with both catecholamines and MSH in causing skin darkening. These data suggest that the dispersion of melanosomes within melanophores in response to both MSH and catecholamines is mediated by cyclic AMP.3. alpha-Adrenoceptor blocking agents inhibit MSH-induced darkening but potentiate catecholamine-induced darkening. beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents, in contrast, inhibit catecholamine-induced darkening but have no effect on MSH-induced darkening. This selective blockade of one receptor while the functional integrity of the other receptor is maintained suggests that MSH and catecholamines increase cyclic AMP levels through different receptors.4. Catecholamines exert their action through beta-adrenoceptors; MSH darkens skins through what appears to be a component of the alpha-adrenoceptor. beta-Adrenoceptor stimulation may stimulate adenyl cyclase to increase cyclic AMP levels whereas MSH may inhibit cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase thereby preventing cyclic AMP breakdown.},

@article{Hadley:1969aa,
	Abstract = {1. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP has been reported to darken skins of the frog, Rana pipiens. This suggests that cyclic 3',5'-AMP may mediate the action of MSH on amphibian chromatophores. Since MSH also darkens skins of the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, we investigated the effects of cyclic 3',5'-AMP and other nucleotides on Anolis melanophores to determine whether cyclic 3',5'-AMP may be the intracellular mediator of hormone action on melanophores of another vertebrate class.2. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP, itself, causes a rapid melanin granule aggregation within melanophores of Anolis. This response is, however, somewhat nonspecific in that both 5'-ATP and 5'-ADP also lighten the skins by aggregating the melanin granules. Another nucleotide, 5'-AMP, darkens the skins by dispersing melanin granules. Cyclic 2',3'-AMP does not darken or lighten Anolis skins.3. Dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP, which is considered to be better able to penetrate membranes and resist degradation by a specific phosphodiesterase, maximally darkens Anolis skins, as does MSH. This darkening by the potent dibutyryl cyclic 3',5'-AMP suggests that cyclic 3',5'-AMP may be the intracellular mediator of melanin granule dispersion within Anolis melanophores leading to skin darkening.4. Other evidence supporting the first-messenger-second-messenger hypothesis for melanophore regulation is discussed.5. The differences in responses of Anolis melanophores to adenine nucleotides may relate to the ability of these agents to penetrate melanophore membranes; thus, the nucleotides could exert their effects either intracellularly or extracellularly on the plasma membrane.},

@article{Haslewood:1969aa,
	Abstract = {1. Bile salts of Petromyzon marinus L. ammocoetes appeared to consist solely or chiefly of a crystalline substance, whose chromatographic and i.r.-spectral characteristics suggested that it was a monosulphate ester of a bile alcohol having the 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy pattern of substitution in a 5alpha-steroid nucleus. 2. This substance on cleavage with dioxan-trichloroacetic acid gave petromyzonol, n.m.r. and mass-spectral examination of which suggested the structure 5alpha-cholane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrol. 3. 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-Trihydroxy-5alpha-cholanoic acid (allocholic acid) from the lizards Anolis lineatopus lineatopus Gray and Cyclura carinata Harlan (family Iguanidae) was esterified with propan-1-ol and reduced by lithium aluminium hydride to 5alpha-cholane-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrol, identical with petromyzonol. 4. Chromic acid oxidation of petromyzonol sulphate from lamprey bile, followed by acid hydrolysis, gave 24-hydroxy-5alpha-cholane-3,7,12-trione; hence the sulphate ester group is at C-24. 5. Petromyzonol sulphate is both primitive and unique: a study of its biogenesis might improve our understanding of evolution at the molecular level.},

Adult males on the average eat a smaller number of prey, and the range in size of prey is larger. The relationship between the average length of the prey and that of the predator is linear when the predator size is above 36 millimeters, but becomes asymptotic when it is below that value. Subadult males as long as adult females eat significantly larger food than do the latter, but only in the larger lizards is this correlated with a relatively larger head. Anolis conspersus selects prey from a wide range of taxa and shows no obvious intraspecific specialization not connected to differences in microhabitat and prey size. The efficiency of this system for solitary species is pointed out.},

When based on protein analyses, identifications of individuals may be less equivocal than identification based on descriptions of skin color and markings.

Such evidence often confirms estimates of relationship derived from more traditional criteria and in some cases provides a basis for formulating new taxonomic conclusions.},

	Abstract = {Clark, H Fred (Communicable Disease Center, Atlanta, Ga.), and Charles C. Shepard. Effect of environmental temperatures on infection with Mycobacterium marinum (Balnei) of mice and a number of poikilothermic species. J. Bacteriol. 86:1057-1069. 1963.-An exploration was made of the effect of environmental temperature on infections with Mycobacterium marinum of mice, young opossums, and bats, and of 50 species of poikilothermic animals. In artificial medium (7H9 broth) M. marinum grew most rapidly from 25 to 35 C, with generation times of 4 to 6 hr. At 37 C, the generation time was 14 hr; at 20 C, 20 hr; and, at 15 C and lower, little growth was observed. In mice, deep body temperatures were found to be 36.5 to 37.3 C at environmental temperatures of 4 to 30 C. At an environmental temperature of 34 C, they averaged 39.1 C; at 37 C they averaged 40.2 C. Foot-pad temperatures were within a few degrees of ambient temperatures from 10 to 34 C. In mouse foot-pad infections, the optimal environmental temperature for infection was 20 C, and the generation time of the infecting bacilli at this environmental temperature was about 15 hr. Intravenously inoculated mice developed peripheral infections of nose, feet, and tail at environmental temperatures of 4 to 30 C. At these temperatures, they had severe pneumonic involvement, and the mice at lower temperatures tended to succumb most rapidly to systemic infection. At 34 C, the intravenously infected mice did not develop peripheral infections and there was no pulmonary involvement. Young opossums, whose deep body temperatures are only 34 to 36 C, were inoculated in the foot-pad and intravenously. Foot-pad infection developed without systemic involvement. Bats, which assume environmental temperature when at rest, were inoculated in the foot-pad. Foot-pad infections were observed but no systemic disease. The bats could be maintained for only short periods, however. Poikilothermic animals were studied. Deep body temperatures were found to be nearly identical with ambient temperature. A total of 50 species of reptiles, amphibians, and fish were infected intraperitoneally in a number of experiments, as animals were available. Susceptibility to M. marinum was found throughout these species. There was no tendency to peripheral involvement. In experiments to determine the optimal environmental temperature for infection, cricket frogs (Acris), American chameleons (Anolis), young garter snakes (Thamnophis), and the young of three species of turtles were inoculated intraperitoneally. The optimal temperature for infection was found to be 30 C in each case, and infections at 20 C were definitely slower. The generation time of M. marinum in American chameleons at 30 C was about 19 hr; at 20 C, it was about 46 hr; and, at 10 C, the bacilli did not apparently multiply. Transmission studies revealed instances where infected animals shed M. marinum into the waters in which they were kept, and where animals became infected from water containing M. marinum.},

Under conditions of direct-coupled amplification, with glass pipette electrodes recording extracellularly from the retinal surface, the response consisted of an increase in negativity maintained throughout prolonged illumination. With capacitance-coupled amplification and metal electrodes, brisk mass discharges of nerve impulses were detected at the onset and cessation of illumination. During illumination a less vigorous maintained discharge was observed.},

	Abstract = {Myoneural junctions in Anolis are characterized by the formation of troughs in the surface of the muscle fibers in which small branches of the terminal axon lie. The muscle surface membrane lining the troughs is thrown into complex branching and anastomosing folds, which compose the subneural apparatus of Couteaux. A compound membrane 500 to 700 A thick separates axoplasm from sarcoplasm at the endings. This consists of five distinct layers and is described in detail. A thin layer of cytoplasm (probably Schwann) separates terminal axoplasm from extracellular space at the surfaces of the junctional troughs. Terminal axoplasm lacks axoplasmic filaments and contains numerous vesicular or tubular appearing structures about 300 to 500 A in diameter. Both terminal axoplasm and sarcoplasm contain numerous mitochondria.},

	Abstract = {Flicker contours from vertebrates (fishes to man) show that the slope parameter sigma'(log I) in the efficiently descriptive probability summation 100 F/F(max.) = integral(-inf;) (log I)e(-(log I/I(i))(-(log I/I(i))2)/2(sigma')(/2(sigma')2) ) .d log I is distributed bimodally (simple fields, "white" light), from 0.60 to 2.3, with well defined peaks at 0.80 and 1.75. This parameter is independent of F(max.), log I(i), temperature, light-time fraction, and in general not greatly influenced by lambda. "Rod" components of known visually duplex contours, without exception, and some "cone" contours, are in the first group; an equal number of "cone" curves are in the second group, together with one simplex "rod" contour; purely cone contours are in each group, as well as cone segments of duplex curves. No firm zoological grouping of the "cone" curves can be made, on present evidence,-although the 5 fishes used give high-slope curves, 2 amphibians low slopes, reptiles (5) either high or low, birds (2) and anthropoids (2) low-slope "cone" curves. By subdivision of the visual image and by change of wave-length, under certain conditions, in man, and by use of the "pecten effect" in birds (and man), cone contours of the low-slope class can be transformed into curves of the high-slope group. These procedures do not fundamentally change the "rod" slopes. Consequently, although under simple conditions they are specifically determined, the forms of the F - log I contour cannot be used as diagnostic for rod or cone functioning. It is reinforced, by new data on Anolis (lizard) and Trionyx (turtle), that an obviously duplex retina is specifically correlated with a duplex performance contour, a simplex retina with a simplex one. But no support is given to the view that the shapes of these curves are diagnostic of differences in rod or cone fundamental excitabilities, or that they describe properties of these units. In visual duplexity we have to do simply with the fact that two groups of neural effects are available; it is with their properties that we deal in measurements of duplex visual excitability.},

@article{Hoagland:1928aa,
	Abstract = {1. The durations of successive periods of induced tonic immobility in the lizard Anolis carolinensis was examined as a function of temperature. An automatic recording method was employed and observations were made of 12,000 to 15,000 immobilizations with six animals over a temperature range of 5 degrees to 35 degrees C. during 5 months. 2. The durations of the immobile periods were found to vary rhythmically in most cases. The reciprocal of the duration of the rhythm, i.e., the rate of change of the process underlying the rhythms, when plotted as a function of temperature according to the Arrhenius equation show distributions of points in two straight line groups. One of these groups or bands of points extends throughout the entire temperature range with a temperature characteristic of approximately micro = 31,000 calories, and the other covers the range of 20 degrees to 35 degrees C. with micro equal to approximately 9,000 calories. 3. The initial stimulus in a series of inductions of immobility appears to set off a mechanism which determines the duration of the state of quiescence. Succeeding forced recoveries seem to have no effect on the normal duration of the rhythm. 4. These results are interpreted by assuming the release, through reflex stimulation, of hormonal substances, one effective between 5 degrees and 35 degrees C. and the other effective between 20 degrees and 35 degrees C. These substances are assumed to act as selective inhibitors of impulses from so called "higher centers," allowing impulses from tonic centers to pass to the muscles. 5. In some experiments a progressive lengthening in successively induced periods of immobility was observed. The logarithm of the frequency of recovery when plotted against time in most of these cases (i.e., except for a few in which irregularities occurred) gave a linear function of negative slope which was substantially unaffected by temperature. In these cases it is assumed that a diffusion process is controlling the amount of available A substance. 6. The results are similar to those obtained by Crozier with Cylisticus convexus. The duration of tonic immobility seems to be maintained in both arthropod and vertebrate by the chemical activity of "hormonal" selective inhibitors. The details of the mechanisms differ, but there is basic similarity. 7. Injections of small amounts of adrenalin above a threshold value are found to prolong the durations of tonic immobility of Anolis, by an amount which is a logarithmic function of the "dose." It is possible that internally secreted adrenalin, above a threshold amount, may be involved in the maintenance of tonic immobility. 8. The production of tonic immobility reflexly is a problem distinct from that of the duration of immobility. It is suggested that the onset may be induced by "shock" to the centers of reflex tonus causing promiscuous discharge of these centers with accompanying inhibition of the higher centers. Such a condition may result when an animal is suddenly lifted from the substratum and overturned, or when, as in the case of Anolis, it struggles with dorsum down. This reaction of the "tonic centers" may at the same time lead to discharge of the adrenal glands by way of their spinal connections thus prolonging the state.},

	Abstract = {Eight adult male lizards of the genus and species Anolis carolinensis were used in this experiment. In order to induce aggressive responding, animals were caged separately and daily underwent pairing with another male, during which aggressive responses and changes in skin color were measured. After obtaining a baseline measure of aggressive responding, animals were injected either with fluoxetine or vehicle-controls in a cross-over design. Subjects were then exposed to five more days of (non drug) pairing with the intruder male, after which they underwent a second trial with fluoxetine/vehicle. Finally, two post-drug paired-trials were obtained. Fluoxetine injection significantly reduced the aggressive responding in the males while causing the postorbital eyespot to significantly darken. Subjects also showed increased aggressivity and skin-color reactivity subsequent to the two drug trials, although it is unclear if the fluoxetine, or non-specific factors of the injection paradigm, accounted for these changes. These results suggest that serotonergic CNS systems tonically regulate aggression in Anolis carolinesis, similar to that seen in many other species. They further suggest that eyespot-darkening and aggressive responding can be pharmacologically dissociated, implicating serotonin in the regulation of this phenomenon.},

@article{Morales:1996aa,
	Abstract = {Tropical anoline lizards have been shown to undergo massive reproductive retrogression when held in captivity. The present study focused on the effects generated by captivity-induced stress on the hepatic expression of vitellogenin (Vtg), the precursor of the major egg yolk proteins, in Anolis pulchellus. Several hepatic dysfunctions accompanying the regression of the reproductive organs were detected when mature highly vitellogenic females were kept in captivity for long periods. These included decreased synthesis of Vtg to undetectable levels after 4 days of captivity concomitant with a large reduction in the levels of its cognate mRNA. In addition, a drastic reduction in Vtg plasma levels preceding the conspicuous cessation of follicular growth was observed. Results suggest the activation of a specific mechanism for rapid clearance of vitellogenic and other female-specific proteins from plasma. The effects of captivity, both in the liver and in the reproductive tract, were alleviated or even reversed by treatment with 17 Beta-estradiol. Hepatic protein synthesis increased threefold when animals were maintained under estrogen therapy during the captivity period. Also, the levels of Vtg mRNA and Vtg protein synthesis and plasma levels were similar or even higher to the observed in control vitellogenic females. Animals treated with 17 beta-estradiol after long-term captivity recovered the normal vitellogenic levels after 72 to 96 hr. Therefore, our results im this tropical anole strongly suggest that the stress effects upon reproductive behavior previously reported in anoline lizards results from suppression of the estrogen stimulus for the hepatic vitellogenic response.},

	Abstract = {The formation of the meninges around the new spinal cord of the regenerating tail of the lizards Anolis and Lampropholis has been studied after injection of 3H-thymidine and 3H-proline. An optical and electron microscopic autoradiographical study revealed that many irregular 3H-thymidine labeled meningeal fibroblasts surround the apical regenerating spinal cord. Meningeal fibroblasts become flat at about 0.5-1 mm from the tail tip while they actively uptake 3H-proline involved in the synthesis of collagen and elastin. Elastic fibres are in intimate contact with the meningeal fibroblasts. One hour after injection of 3H-proline trace grains were seen most in the Golgi apparatus and secretory elastin-like vesicles. The importance of the elastic fibrils around the caudal spinal cord of lizard in relation to the body movements is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The development of scales was analysed in embryos of the Jamaican Iguanid lizard Anolis lineatopus after the injection of cell proliferation markers [3H]thymidine and 5-bromodeoxyuridine. Embryos were fixed at successive postinjection periods, from 2 h up to 13 d and sections of developing skin were studied by autoradiography and immunocytochemistry. The epidermis during the initial stages of morphogenesis (flat epidermis and symmetric scale stages) expands chiefly by the tangential proliferation of the basal layer. The superficial periderm took part in its own laminar expansion. The rates of proliferation in the epidermis and dermis were similar during the flat epidermal stage, but dermal proliferation decreased under the wave-like epidermis of symmetric scales. No specific localisation of proliferating cells was visible either in the epidermis and or the dermis at these 2 early stages. Scale asymmetry is brought about by cell multiplication and hypertrophy of the cells of the future outer surface of the scale that behaves as an epithelial placode capable of producing beta-keratinised cells. The growth of the outer surface determines the asymmetry of the scale. Conversely, the future inner side and hinge region showed a lower degree of cell proliferation and cells remained cuboidal or became flat. Also the proliferation of the dermis under the scaling epidermis was significantly diminished. During the asymmetric scale stage, labelled cells were more common in the hypertrophied basel epithelium from 2 h until 4 d postinjection, during which time a few cells moved into the upper keratinizing layers. At 6-13 d postinjection, labelled cells were commonly seen in the upper beta-keratinising layers.},

	Abstract = {The recognition of liver and serum polypeptides in Anolis pulchellus by a polyclonal antibody against S1-lipovitellin confirmed their identity as vitellogenins (Vtg) and demonstrated their structural relationship to yolk lipoproteins. In vivo labeling demonstrated active synthesis of Vtg by vitellogenic females since intracellular incorporation of [3H]-leucine was detected at short periods of label in all five Anolis Vtg forms. Time course analysis of 3H-Vtg levels indicated a 1 hr lag phase between synthesis and secretion. On the other hand, 32P-Vtg appears to be rapidly secreted from the liver into the blood since label was detected simultaneously in both compartments. After 2 hr intracellular 32P-Vtg levels reached a plateau. Decreasing 32P-Vtg levels in the blood were observed several hours after injection. In growing oocytes 32P was detected in yolk phosphoproteins ranging from 37,000 to 75,000 in molecular weight. Based on these results together with previous published data we conclude that in tropical anole the yolk phosphoproteins appear to be derived from the larger highly phosphorylated Vtg forms according to the typical vertebrate Vtg precursor-product relationship. However, the main component of yolk lipovitellin is synthesized in the liver as an independent lipoprotein (Vtg-116) which is taken up by growing oocytes without major proteolytic modifications. This novel mode of lipovitellin biosynthesis and deposit in reptiles has not been reported previously.},

Lowest prevalence occurred at dry, windy sites or cool, wet mountain peaks (0-20%); the parasites were more common at most other locations on the island (40-80% infected; overall prevalence = 47%). High and low prevalence sites sometimes were only a few hundred meters apart. Prevalence was similar for males and females but increased with body size except for a decline in the largest ( = oldest) lizards. A surplus of mixed infections (P. floridense and P. azurophilum together in the same host) existed compared with chance proportions. Parasitemia generally was low; 70% of P. floridense infections were < or = 100 parasites/10,000 erythrocytes, and 70% of P. azurophilum infections were < or = 50/10,000.

	Abstract = {Recent biochemical and immunocytochemical evidence indicates that a population of circadian and reproductive rhythm-entraining photoreceptors lies in the basal diencephalon of iguanid lizards. Here, we report the results of correlated light and electron microscopy of opsin-immunoreactive cells in the basal brain, and we discuss their ultrastructural relationship to known photoreceptors. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting bipolar neurons in the lizards Anolis carolinensis and Iguana iguana were immunolabeled with antisera generated against vertebrate retinal opsins and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Within the brain, opsin-immunoreactive cells were found exclusively in the ependyma of the basal region of the lateral ventricles (adjacent to nucleus paraolfactorius/nucleus ventromedialis and neostriatum/paleostriatum). Cells in the same anatomical location and with the same morphology were labeled with anti-VIP antisera. These cells possessed a dendritic process that extended toward the lateral ventricle, ending in a bulbous terminal that protruded into the ventricle. Axonal processes travelled ventrally and caudally. The entire cell, including the axonal process, exhibited opsin-like and VIP-like immunoreactivity. By light microscopy, opsin-like immunostaining appeared punctate, with immunoreactivity greatest in the bulbous terminal. Opsin- and VIP-immunostained thick sections were resectioned, and individual cells observed by light microscopy were then characterized using electron microscopy. We found that all immunostained cells were morphologically similar and that they were morphologically distinct from neighboring nonimmunoreactive cells. CSF-contacting opsin- and VIP-immunoreactive cells lacked the membranous stacks characteristic of retinal photoreceptors but were ciliated and contained numerous large electron-dense vesicles. Multiple synaptic contacts were made on the soma and putative dendritic processes of opsin- and VIP-immunoreactive CSF-contacting neurons. Our results provide the first ultrastructural characterization of opsin-immunostained encephalic CSF-contacting neurons in a vertebrate animal, and they indicate that these putative photoreceptors share structural features with pineal photoreceptors and with certain invertebrate extraretinal photoreceptors, but they are morphologically and biochemically distinct from visual photoreceptors of the retina.},

@article{Schneider:1996aa,
	Abstract = {Distinguishing between primary and secondary intergradation among differentiated populations, and the relative importance of drift and selection, are persistent problems in evolutionary biology. An historical perspective on population interactions can provide insight into the nature of contacts, and thus help resolve these questions. Continuously distributed populations of Anolis marmoratus from the island of Basse Terre in the Guadeloupean archipelago of the Lesser Antilles show a striking degree of geographic variation in morphology. Initial surveys of mtDNA variation from throughout the Guadeloupean Archipelago revealed one case where levels of sequence difference and phylogenetic relationships of alleles from morphologically differentiated populations from the east coast of Basse Terre were consistent with primary intergradation. In this paper, I examine the genetic population structure of a series of populations spanning this north-south cline in morphological variation to test the hypothesis of primary intergradation. Sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene from 50 individuals representing five populations spanning the cline were obtained and fourteen unique haplotypes (differing by 2% or less) were detected. Patterns of nucleotide substitution among haplotypes do not deviate from neutral expectation indicating no effect of selection at the level of mtDNA sequences. Estimates of population structure and gene flow were made using both summary statistics for nucleotide diversity (Nst) and cladistic methods. The results are sensitive to the choice of gene flow model, and this is discussed in detail. Mitochondrial variation in the northern populations may not be at equilibrium, and the phylogeny of alleles is consistent with a recent increase in effective population size. Estimates of nucleotide diversity, gene flow, and the phylogenetic relationships of haplotypes indicate that the southern-most population (representing the extreme of morphological variation along this cline) has been relatively isolated from populations to the north and has experienced a reduced effective population size. The apparent clinal variation between the southern population and the others may therefore reflect secondary contact and introgression rather than primary intergradation.},

	Abstract = {Autoradiographic mapping criteria were employed to identify and localize specific high affinity binding sites (receptors) for the steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3) in the brain of Anolis carolinensis. In female and male lizards binding of tritiated 1,25-D3 occurred in identical regions of the fore-, mid-, and hindbrain, similar to findings in other species. There was a band of intensely labeled neurons forming a continuum from the n. accumbens, n. striae terminalis, the striatum, and extending into the amygdala. Target areas with high to intermediate labeling intensities were present in many other regions of the brain and single, small target cells were found throughout the organ. Some cells in the pituitary and pineal were labeled and also cells associated with the meninges, choroid plexuses and ependyma. The differential labeling suggests the existence of different 1,25-D3-responsive systems. One of the conspicuous "high capacity-high affinity systems" is found in the n. accumbens-n. striae terminalis and the amygdala. Most of the cerebral target regions for vitamin D correspond to those known for gonadal steroids, and the seasonal steroid 1,25-D3 may therefore act in conjunction with gonadal steroids in this seasonally breeding reptile.},

Skinks and anoles were exposed by needle inoculation or tick bite to B. burgdorferi. Xenodiagnosis with larval Ixodes scapularis and culture of tissues were used to asses infection and the ability of infected lizards to infect attached ticks. Both lizard species were susceptible to B. burgdorferi by both routes of exposure. Xenodiagnostic ticks acquired spirochetes while feeding on both species. One tick that dropped from a skink on the ninth day after exposure was infected. The remainder of xenodiagnostic ticks that acquired spirochetes fed three weeks after exposure of the lizards to the spirochete. Lizards remained infectious to attached ticks for at least five weeks. Overall, more than 20% of xenodiagnostic larvae fed on southeastern five-lined skinks acquired spirochetes. Individual skinks infected up to 34% of attached ticks. A smaller proportion of ticks feeding on green anoles became infected. Borrelia burgdorferi recovered from infected lizards retained their infectivity for mammalian hosts. The ability of the lizards to sustain a Borrelia infection and infect attached ticks suggests that they may play a role in the maintenance of spirochete transmission.},

	Abstract = {Receptor autoradiography was used for the demonstration of specific binding of the tritiated steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the eyes and associated tissues of Anolis carolinensis. A 100-fold excess of non-labelled 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 abolished specific nuclear binding of tracer. Nuclear [3H]-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 binding was present in all animals in the retina stratum ganglionare and stratum nuclear externum as well as in the cornea; however, binding was absent in the optic nerve, except in cells of the surrounding arachnoidea. Additional cranial tissues such as chondrocytes in the sclera, parasphenoid, skeletal muscle cells, and epithelial cells of the lacrimal and Harderian glands exhibited nuclear labelling. The results suggest that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 has genomic regulatory actions that involve cell proliferation, differentiation, and functions of certain cells of the eye and associated cranial tissues. The presence of vitamin D receptors in tissues of the eye and skeletal muscle in the reptile is in part different from that observed in mammals. In general, receptors for vitamin D and related target tissues appear to be even more extensive in lizards than has been observed in rodents, which may reflect a more extensive dependency of these tissues on solar environment and active seasonal and circadian regulation.},

This RH2 group includes the green-sensitive opsins in chicken and goldfish and the blue-sensitive opsin in a nocturnal lizard gecko. In the present study, we isolated and sequenced the genomic DNA clones for the RH2 opsin gene, rh2Ac, of the diurnal lizard Anolis carolinensis. This single-copy gene spans 18.3 kb from start to stop codons, making it the longest opsin gene known in vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis strongly suggests that rh2Ac is more closely related to the chicken green opsin gene than to the gecko blue opsin gene. This gene tree differs from the organismal tree, where the two lizard species should be most closely related, implying that rh2Ac and the gecko blue-sensitive opsin genes have been derived from duplicate ancestral genes.},

	Abstract = {We used the transmembrane distribution of 5,5-[2-14C]dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione ([14C]DMO) and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to investigate the effects of hypercapnia on intracellular pH (pHi) in brain and skeletal muscle of two lizard species: Anolis equestris and Dipsosaurus dorsalis. In control animals (normocapnic), plasma PCO2 (3.3 +/- 0.1 kPa) and plasma pH (7.52 +/- 0.01) for D. dorsalis were not significantly different from the values for A. equestris (2.8 +/- 0.2 kPa and 7.59 +/- 0.02, respectively). Furthermore 60 min of 5% CO2 increased plasma PCO2 and decreased plasma pH by the same amounts in both species. Brain pHi values determined with the DMO method were not significantly different from values determined with NMR. Control values of brain pHi (DMO, 7.16 +/- 0.01; NMR, 7.11 +/- 0.02) and muscle pHi were significantly higher for D. dorsalis (DMO, 7.15 +/- 0.03) than for A. equestris (DMO, 6.99 +/- 0.03; NMR, 7.02 +/- 0.02 for brain; DMO, 6.97 +/- 0.03 for muscle). In addition, changes in tissue pHi after 60 min of 5% CO2 were significantly different for the two species. In D. dorsalis muscle and brain pHi decreased significantly after hypercapnia, whereas in A. equestris muscle pHi decreased significantly but brain pHi was unchanged. Our findings were independent of the methods used to determine pHi. The smaller change in brain and muscle pHi than in plasma pH for A. equestris is consistent with the view that pHi regulation involves active processes such as transmembrane ion transport.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {In order to study the pattern of growth of regenerating cartilage, H3-thymidine was injected in individuals of the lizards Anolis carolinensis and Lampropholis delicata during advanced stages of tail regeneration. Light and electron microscopic autoradiographical analysis showed that the regenerating cartilaginous tube was mostly derived from the interstitial proliferation of chondroblasts. Appositional growth is limited during the initial stages of cartilage formation. Later, after the differentiation of an inner and outer perichondrium, a few cells were added to the cartilaginous tube while cellular degeneration of the calcifying areas was in progress. In this way a constant diameter of the cartilaginous tube was maintained. In order to study the rate of production of matrix protein (collagen), H3-proline was administered to other samples of Lampropholis. To the best of the author's knowledge this was done for the first time in the cartilage of a reptiles. The tracier was mostly localized in the apical-intermediate cartilage and one hour postinjection it was mostly concentrated in the ergastoplasm around the Golgi apparatus and its secretory vesicles. Three hours after the injection of H3-proline some of the tracier was found in the cytoplasm of chondrocytes and in the extracellular matrix.},

	Abstract = {The differentiation of muscles in the lizards Anolis and Lampropholis with tails that had regenerated for 21-50 d was investigated by light and electron microscope autoradiography using tritiated thymidine. At the apex of the regenerating tail, groups of 4-8 myoblasts of the promuscle aggregates fused to produce bundles of myotubes whose multiple labelled and unlabelled nuclei appeared to be distributed at random. The formation of the first myotubes and their growth is responsible for the formation of the myotome primordia and their separation from the intermuscular connective myosepta. More nuclei were added with the lengthening of the myotubes--up to 14-18 nuclei in the oldest proximal myotubes. At 4-5 h after injection labelled nuclei were found outside the myotubes while at 2-6 d after injection many labelled nuclei were observed in the myotubes, particularly near the two ends of the myotubular sarcoplasm contacting the myoseptum. This change from the initial distribution suggests that the growth of the myotubes takes place mostly at their terminals. There is an apparent correlation between the number of nuclei and the final length of the myotubes and myotome. The insertion of fibres with a similar number of nuclei and lengths into the pinnated connective myoseptum of the original musculature, the autotomy plane, probably determines the wave-like shape of the muscles within the regenerated myotomes.},

	Abstract = {Many stimuli, including social aggression, activate endocrine stress mechanisms, presumably mediated or modulated by central neurotransmitters. To determine the effects of aggression on central neurochemistry, reproductively active male Anolis carolinensis were paired and allowed to establish social dominance relationships. While combatants cohabited, the fight losers invariably became socially subordinate and displayed darker color, selection of lower perch sites, and lower body posture than the winners. After one hour, one day, one week, or one month of cohabitation animals were sacrificed. Each member of a pair was killed at approximately the same time, along with animals kept isolated as controls. Diencephalon, non-optic lobe midbrain and hindbrain were analyzed for indoleamines, catecholamines and metabolites by coulochem electrode array HPLC. Early activation (by one hour) of the serotonergic system in subordinate male lizards was indicated by decreased serotonin (5-HT), increased 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio. Substrate 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP) also increased in losing males, suggesting enhanced production as well as turnover. Significant 5-HTP and 5-HIAA/5-HT increases for subordinate males, compared with levels in control and dominant males, were greatest at one hour and diminished thereafter. This pattern of indoleamine system activation is consistent with stress-induced stimulation of the serotonergic system and prolonged activation of the stress response in subordinate animals, as well as serotonergic inhibition of aggression. In contrast with serotonin, subordinate males did not have increased catecholamine system activation following one hour of interaction. The ratio of DOPAC/dopamine was lower following one hour of interaction in subordinate males. Adrenergic system activation, indicated by metanephrine/epinephrine ratio, increased with time in losing males, except that after one month of cohabitation, turnover returned to levels that equaled those of control animals. Noradrenergic metabolite MHPG, as well as MHPG/NE ratio, were significantly reduced in dominant males at one hour and one week. Changes in adrenergic system activation, not seen in or registered by noradrenergic systems, indicate a possible role for central epinephrine in social stress accommodation.},

	Abstract = {Photocrosslinking of receptors for alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) on melanophores of frogs and lizards has been shown to induce long-lasting receptor stimulation whereby the photoreactive alpha-MSH may contain one or two photolabels in positions 1, 7, 9, or 13. The chemical synthesis and biological testing of an alpha-MSH analogue is now described which contains three photoreactive groups in positions 1, 9 and 13, one of which with a cleavable S-S disulphide bridge: [ApSSpr-Ser1, Trp(Naps)9 Pap13]-alpha-MSH. Photocrosslinking of MSH receptors on melanophores of Anolis carolinensis with this analogue led to almost complete receptor blockade which could be transformed into long-lasting receptor stimulation by exposure to a thiol reagent. By contrast, the analogue containing only two photoreactive groups in positions 9 and 13, [Trp(Naps)9, Pap13]-alpha-MSH, produced long-lasting receptor stimulation which was not altered by the thiol reagent. These results demonstrate that one and the same peptide ligand may contain structural information for both receptor activation and inhibition and that the receptor may become arrested in an activated or inhibited state by multiple photocrosslinking, depending on the relative positions of these crosslinks.},

In the present study, we isolated and sequenced a genomic DNA clone for the A. carolinensis Rh gene. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence revealed six A. carolinensis-specific replacements in conserved aa residues among vertebrate Rhs. Four out of these six replacements (S22N, N199H, E232A and T319M) reside outside the transmembrane (TM) domains. Some of these replacements might have been required for Rh to function solely in the pineal gland.},

	Abstract = {During scale morphogenesis in the regenerating tail of lizards (Anolis and Lampropholis) the structure of the dermis undergoes changes in relation to the ingrowth of epidermal papillae to form the new scales. Cell proliferation in the dermis, as revealed by the uptake of 3H-thymidine, is high in the prescaling region of the regenerating tail but lower than the proliferation in the epidermis. Under the epidermis of the scaling region dermal cell proliferation rapidly drops down under the distal (apical) and proximal (caudal) sides of the infolding epidermal papillae. Dermal fibroblasts take up 3H-proline in high amounts, especially in the forming deep dermal layer, where many collagen fibrils are laid down forming dense connective. Electron microscopic study revealed that "anchoring filaments" link the basement membrane of the epidermis with the deep dermis, in particular in the sinking hinge region. As a result of the higher proliferation of the epidermis with respect to the dermis (heterochrony) and the presence of dermo-epithelial "anchoring filaments", the superficial laminar epidermis sinks into the dermis to produce new scales. The epidermal downpushing is evidenced by a characteristic distortion of the dermal fibrils under the distal and the proximal sides, and in the hinge region of the forming scales.},

@article{Grace:1994aa,
	Abstract = {Melatonin modulates a variety of rhythmic processes in vertebrates, and is synthesized in both the retina and pineal gland. We have shown previously that retinal melatonin is deacetylated generating 5-methoxytryptamine, which is then deaminated by monoamine oxidase, producing 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol. This process occurs within the eyes of a variety of vertebrates including the iguanid lizard Anolis carolinensis. To determine whether melatonin deacetylase activity also occurs in the pineal organ or in other parts of the lizard brain, pineals and brains of Anolis carolinensis and Sceloporus jarrovi were cultured in the presence of [3H-methoxy]-melatonin. High-performance liquid chromatography of the resulting culture media and tissues revealed the generation of radiolabeled 5-methoxytryptamine and 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid. These two methoxyindoles were the only radiolabeled metabolites detectable, and together accounted for all melatonin lost. Both the loss of melatonin and the production of melatonin metabolites were inhibited by inclusion of 100 microM eserine, an inhibitor of the melatonin deacetylase. Pargyline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, reduced the production of 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and increased the production of 5-methoxytryptamine relative to control incubations. Similar effects of eserine and pargyline were seen in eyecup, brain and pineal gland, but the specific activity of melatonin deacetylation in cultured pineal glands was much greater than in either brains or eyecups. These results indicate that pineal glands of both Anolis carolinensis and Sceloporus jarrovi can rapidly catabolize melatonin by a mechanism very similar to that in the eye, that the melatonin deacetylation pathway exists elsewhere in the iguanid brain, and also extend our previous observations of ocular melatonin deacetylation to an additional species.},

	Abstract = {Acid extracts of the pars intermedia of the squamate reptile Lacerta galloti were screened for immunoreactive forms of proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-related end products following Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. alpha-MSH-sized end products were detected with a Val-NH2, C-terminal-specific RIA, and beta-endorphin-sized end products were detected with a separate C-terminal-directed RIA. Five peaks of alpha-MSH-related immunoreactivity were isolated following fractionation by reversed-phase HPLC. Based on a comparison of the reversed-phase HPLC properties and the net positive charges (pH 2.75) of the Lacerta forms of alpha-MSH to those of the mammalian forms of alpha-MSH and Anolis carolinensis ACTH(1-13)NH2, it appears that the N-acetylation of alpha-MSH is a major post-translational processing event in the pars intermedia of L. galloti. Although multiple forms of beta-endorphin were detected in the pars intermedia of L. galloti following cation-exchange chromatography, the low levels of N-acetylated beta-endorphin detected with an N-acetyl-specific beta-endorphin RIA indicate that the N-acetylation of beta-endorphin in this species is a minor post-translational processing event. This pattern of POMC processing in the pars intermedia of L. galloti is similar to the processing events observed for the turtle Pseudemys scripta, but distinct from the processing events observed in the squamate reptile A. carolinensis.},

	Abstract = {Aggressive interactions in Anolis carolinensis result in increased circulating levels of epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) and conspicuous color changes. This activation of the adrenergic component of an acute stress response is externally represented by the darkening of the postorbital eyespot of A. carolinensis. In adult males, this site darkens in response to stressful physical stimulation (trauma, passive restraint) or psychological stimuli, most notably the sight of an aggressively intruding conspecific. Aggressive male A. carolinensis exhibit postorbital eyespot darkening; animals that have a longer latency to expression of this eyespot and those that never show this response were defeated in agonistic interactions. Also, during agonistic interactions, subjects that subsequently win are the first to display eyespot darkening. Plasma catecholamine levels are significantly elevated within 30 sec in both combatants. At 30 sec following the determination of the outcome, winning male lizards have plasma NE levels which are higher than those of losers. Castration, however, significantly increases the latency to eyespot darkening and extends its duration. Testosterone levels may therefore enhance the onset of Epi-mediated eyespot darkening as well as other aspects of the endocrine stress response. Elevated androgen levels and more rapid activation of acute catecholamine response increases the likelihood of becoming socially dominant.},

@article{Wiechmann:1994aa,
	Abstract = {Melatonin binding sites were identified in the brain and retina of the lizard Anolis carolinensis using in vitro autoradiography. Radioactive labeling was observed in areas which receive primary, secondary, and tertiary visual input: the superficial layers of the optic tectum, lateral geniculate nucleus, nucleus rotundus, dorsal ventricular ridge, and striatum. Other areas that demonstrated binding included the left medial habenular nucleus, the interpeduncular nucleus, medial cortex, dorsal cortex, mammillary nucleus, and septum. In the retina, melatonin binding was localized in the inner plexiform layer. Radioactive melatonin binding to the optic tectum was reduced in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable cyclic GMP analog, indicating that the melatonin receptor in the brain of this lizard is associated with a G-protein. These results suggest that melatonin receptor binding sites are widely distributed in the forebrain and midbrain of the iguanid lizard, and are prominent in areas of the nervous system that are associated with visual processing. The highest degree of melatonin binding appeared in the left medial habenular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, and dorsal ventricular ridge. This suggests that these brain regions may be important targets for the actions of melatonin, such as its effects on circadian rhythmicity, thermoregulation and photoperiodic reproduction.},

	Abstract = {Regenerating scales in lizards originate as pockets in the epidermis instead of epidermal elevations as during embryo development. The morphogenesis of scales in the regenerating tail of the lizards. Anolis and Lamphropholis was studied after peritoneal injection of 3H-thymidine. The tracer was localized in the forming epidermis after progressive post-injection times, by means of autoradiography on plastic sections. After 4-5 hours post-injection of 3H-thymidine, the radioactivity was localized in the basal layer. After 2 to 4 days post-injection labelled cells were seen in the basal and intermediate spinosus layers but not in the uppermost keratinizing layers. Labelled cells were seen in the differentiating cornifying layers (pre-beta and pre-alpha) 6-8 days post-injection. At 12-14 days post-injection almost no radioactivity was seen in the basal layer or in the living part of the epidermis. A few labelled cells were present in the dense keratinizing layers of the sloughing wound and interscale lacunar layers. This study shows that scale formation and morphogenesis in the regenerating tail is brought about by a localized cell proliferation along the regenerating epidermis. In the forming scales the percentage of labelled cells in the distal side (future dorsal part of the new scale) is much higher than in the proximal side (the future ventral side of the scale), so that overlapped scales are generated.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a mathematical model which allows us to compare the data collected from short-term cross-sectional surveys with the population dynamics of host and parasite populations over longer periods of time. The model extends an earlier framework for two parasite species in one host, to one for an arbitrary number of parasite species. We show that the conditions necessary for the coexistence of two parasite species extend to expressions for the coexistence of three or more parasite species. Furthermore, the model suggests that those species which form the 'core' of the parasite community are those whose high fecundity and transmission efficiency permit them to colonize hosts readily. In contrast, those species which are classified as 'satellite' species of the community are either species with low fecundity, or low transmission efficiencies. This work confirms earlier studies that suggest that increasing degrees of aggregation are crucial in allowing several species of parasites to coexist in the same species of hosts. The properties of the model are compared with patterns observed in data collected for helminth parasites of Anolis lizards, wood mice and eels. This combined theoretical and empirical approach confirms the importance of the life history strategies of the parasite in determining the abundance of each species in the community. It suggests that studies of parasite community structure have to pay more attention to the strategies pursued by each individual species before interactions between species are considered.},

@article{Sherry:1993aa,
	Abstract = {Golgi-impregnated amacrine cells in the all-cone lizard retina (Anolis carolinensis) were characterized on the bases of dendritic and somatic criteria. Four major cell categories, comprising 23 types were identified: three non-stratified, 13 monostratified, five bistratified, and two tristratified types. Four of the cell types comprised two to four subtypes based on stratification of their dendrites within the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Golgi impregnation strongly favoured monostratified amacrine cells with cell bodies at the proximal margin of the inner nuclear layer. The neurotransmitter content of each of the 23 amacrine cell types was examined by combined Golgi-immunocytochemistry after morphological classification. Putative neurotransmitters examined included gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine (GLY) and aspartate (ASP). Seventeen cell types showed GABA-immunoreactivity (IR), three cell types showed GLY-IR, and four cell types showed neither GABA-IR nor GLY-IR. No cell types showed ASP-IR. Each cell type had a characteristic neurochemical signature, with the exception of one monostratified cell type that showed three different neurochemical signatures. Postembedding immunocytochemistry on conventionally processed retinas confirmed the localization of glutamic acid decarboxylase, the synthetic enzyme for GABA, to cells similar to several of the GABA-IR Golgi-stained types. Postembedding immunocytochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase (the synthetic enzyme for catecholamines) and GABA on serial sections demonstrated colocalization of GABA and a catecholamine, probably dopamine, in a bistratified amacrine cell type. We conclude that GABA-IR amacrine cell types are more numerous and morphologically heterogeneous than GLY-IR amacrine cells. The morphological heterogeneity and, with one exception, exclusivity of GABA-IR and GLY-IR amacrine cell types indicate that both neurotransmitters play a variety and different functional roles in the lizard inner retina.},

It is not known whether individual, physically isolated pineal cells are capable of generating a circadian oscillation in melatonin release. This question was addressed by utilizing a reverse hemolytic plaque assay for the detection of melatonin secretion from individual pineal cells. Dissociated pineal cells from the anole lizard, maintained in short term culture, displayed a marked variation in melatonin secretion for up to 72 h under both cyclic lighting conditions and in constant dark. The persistence of daily fluctuations of melatonin secretion from individual cells strongly suggests that individual pineal cells can function as circadian oscillators.},

	Abstract = {We describe a research protocol for evaluating temperature regulation from data on small field-active ectothermic animals, especially lizards. The protocol requires data on body temperatures (Tb) of field-active ectotherms, on available operative temperatures (Te, "null temperatures" for nonregulating animals), and on the thermoregulatory set-point range (preferred body temperatures, Tset). These data are used to estimate several quantitative indexes that collectively summarize temperature regulation: the "precision" of body temperature (variance in Tb, or an equivalent metric), the "accuracy" of body temperature relative to the set-point range (the average difference between Tb and Tset), and the "effectiveness" of thermoregulation (the extent to which body temperatures are closer on the average to the set-point range than are operative temperatures). If additional data on the thermal dependence of performance are available, the impact of thermoregulation on performance (the extent to which performance is enhanced relative to that of nonregulating animals) can also be estimated. A sample analysis of the thermal biology of three Anolis lizards in Puerto Rico demonstrates the utility of the new protocol and its superiority to previous methods of evaluating temperature regulation. We also discuss several ways in which the research protocol can be extended and applied to other organisms.},

Its retina is unusual for possessing two foveas (areas associated with heightened visual acuity), with the major, central fovea deeply incised and very densely packed with photoreceptors. Immunoblotting and light- and electron microscopic-immunocytochemistry, using several opsin monoclonal antibodies previously found specific for rods, demonstrated the presence and localization of this protein in the Anolis retina. This visual pigment appears sparsely in a subpopulation of photoreceptors in the periphery but overwhelmingly in the central fovea. Complementary results with cone-specific antibody and lectin binding corroborated this spatial organization. These results, as well as those with geckos, suggest that photoreceptor morphology is not an accurate guide among the lacertilians to visual pigment content, and that this phylogenetic grouping may constitute a crossroads in vertebrate photoreceptor evolution.},

	Abstract = {Preserved museum specimens of 13 lizard and 3 snake species common in the southeastern U.S.A. were examined for immature Ixodes scapularis Say ticks. Five Eumeces and 4 Ophisaurus lizard species yielded an infestation prevalence of 17.8% for species of Eumeces and 29.0% for species of Ophisaurus. Mean intensity of larvae and nymphs was 7.1 and 2.7, respectively, for species of Eumeces, and 6.3 and 1.4, respectively, for species of Ophisaurus. Collection dates of the lizards ranged from January through December, but most were collected from March through October. The maximum number of immatures found on a single specimen was 193 larvae and 11 nymphs on a specimen of Eumeces and 75 larvae and 7 nymphs on a specimen of Ophisaurus. For species of Eumeces, 75.2% of all nymphs observed were attached in the shoulder area. Larvae were most abundant on the rear legs (53.3%), followed by the front legs (26.3%) and shoulders (12.9%). Larvae and nymphs on species of Ophisaurus were found almost exclusively in the lateral groove area (84.0% and 94.4%, respectively). Three other lizard species (Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus undulatus, Scincella lateralis) had only a few ticks or none. A fourth species, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus, hosted a total of 3 larvae on 3 specimens (infestation prevalence, 10.7%). Three snake species (Diadophis punctatus, Virginia striatula, Crotalus adamanteus) had none.},

@article{Hyde:1993aa,
	Abstract = {Experiments were conducted to determine if a correlation exists between any aspect of the pineal melatonin rhythm (such as its duration or phase) in the lizard Anolis carolinensis and the reproductive response to photoperiod. The rhythm of pineal melatonin content was determined in anoles exposed to nightbreak lighting protocols (10L:5D:1L:8D, 10L:10D:1L:3D), resonance lighting cycles (LD 11:13, LD 11:25), and T-cycle lighting protocols (LD 11:7, LD 11:9, LD 11:13, LD 11:15, LD 11:19) and compared with the testicular response to these lighting protocols as determined previously [Underwood and Hyde, (1990) J. Comp. Physiol. (A) 167:231-243]. Different T-cycles and nightbreak cycles elicited changes in both the duration of the melatonin peak and the phase of the melatonin peak relative to these light cycles. The response to the resonance cycle (LD 11:25) was complex, probably due to the overlapping patterns of two groups whose pineal melatonin rhythms were entrained approximately 12 hr out of phase with each other. No correlation was observed between the duration, or the amplitude, of the nocturnal melatonin peaks seen on the various light cycles and the reproductive response to these cycles. A correlation was observed between the phase of the pineal melatonin rhythm and the reproductive response. Light cycles were inductive (stimulated testicular growth) when the entrained melatonin rhythm peaked near the light-to-dark or the dark-to-light transition, but they were not inductive when the melatonin rhythm peaked during the middle third of the night. These results suggest that if melatonin is involved in the transduction of photoperiodic information in Anolis, neither the duration nor amplitude of the nocturnal melatonin pulse is involved in the measurement of day length. Instead, the phase-relationship of the melatonin rhythm to the rest of the circadian system may determine photoperiodic responsiveness.},

	Abstract = {Fully terrestrial vertebrates were previously thought to exclusively employ vitamin A1 to generate visual pigments. However, recent studies on the visual system of the lizard Anolis carolinensis have shown that its visual pigments are vitamin A2-based. This unexpected result prompted an investigation of the pineal photopigments in this species [13]. HPLC analysis has shown that this extraretinal photoreceptor also exclusively utilizes a vitamin A2-derived chromophore. The adaptive significance of this chromophore within the pineal is unclear. The extended long wavelength sensitivity characteristic of vitamin A2-based visual pigment systems may enhance important visual tasks such as prey detection or mate selection [13]. A similar argument cannot be made for the pineal, whose role is not image formation, but rather detection of the irradiance changes associated with dawn and dusk. We suggest that the pineal may passively utilize whatever retinoids have been adaptively selected by the visual system.},

	Abstract = {The reliance on anaerobic metabolism during exercise in lizards has been the subject of a growing body of literature in activity metabolism. Prior studies have demonstrated that lizards rely more on postexercise lactate to regenerate depleted glycogen stores than do many mammals. These studies prompted an in vitro comparison between the metabolic mechanisms for the handling of lactate and glucose in the muscles of a small mammal and lizard. Hindlimb muscles of Mus and Anolis were stimulated to fatigue and then incubated in the presence of 15 mM lactate and either 5.5 (mice) or 8.5 (anoles) mM glucose. Oxidation rates of lactate and glucose were seven to eight times higher in mice. Both species oxidized more lactate than glucose (8 to 9 times). However, anole muscle showed a preference for lactate as a substrate for glycogenesis, incorporating 1.5 times as much lactate (expressed in glucose equivalents) as glucose. In contradistinction, mice incorporated 2.8 times as much glucose into glycogen as lactate. The quantitative differences in metabolic scope of mammals and reptiles are accompanied by fundamental differences in the capacity and patterns of skeletal muscle metabolism of lactate and glucose.},

	Abstract = {Tongue-flicking in reptiles is frequently seen to increase in novel habitats and is presumed to involve the acquisition of chemical information. Like most behavioral patterns, however, tongue-flicking has both multiple causes and multiple functions, only some of which involve chemosensation. This paper describes units of exploratory behavior, including use of the tongue, in a microsmatic lizard, the green anole, Anolis carolinensis. This species employs its tongue in a manner suggestive of chemosensory exploration, but it possesses modest peripheral chemosensory organs and reduced central representation of chemosensory target cell groups. Further, specific elements of exploratory behavior are affected differently by treatments that involve altering levels of stress-sensitive hormones, androgen, and central catecholamines. Such differential responses suggest that exploratory behavior is an ensemble of individual units, some of which are selectively sensitive to specific physiological elements of the stress response and of elevated arousal.},

	Abstract = {Crosslinking of MSH receptors on melanophores of the lizard Anolis carolinensis with analogues of alpha-MSH containing a photoreactive group in position 1, 7, 9 or 13 leads to long-lasting receptor stimulation. Reversibility of this long-lasting stimulation is obtained by employing a disulfide-containing photoreactive group which can be cleaved from the receptor by thiol reagents [Ref. 3]. When two photoreactive groups are simultaneously present on the alpha-MSH molecule (e.g in positions 1 + 9; 1 + 13; 7 + 13, or 9 + 13), identical results were obtained and long-lasting receptor stimulation was not altered after cleavage of one single crosslink. alpha-MSH analogues with three photoreactive groups in positions 1 + 7 + 13 led to irreversible receptor stimulation whereas one compound with the photoreactive groups in positions 1 + 9 + 13 induced reversible receptor inactivation which could be changed into long-lasting stimulation by cleaving the crosslink at position 1 of alpha-MSH. These results demonstrate that one and the same peptide ligand may contain structural information for both receptor activation and inhibition and that the receptor may become arrested in an activated or inhibited state by multiple photocrosslinking, depending on the relative positions of these crosslinks.},

	Abstract = {Thirteen lizards (Anolis carolinensis and Scincella lateralis) were injected with 3H-GABA (tritiated gamma-aminobutyric acid) in order to study its localization inside the regenerating tail spinal cord (SC) by means of light and electron microscopic autoradiography. One and three hours after intraperitoneal injection, the radioactivity was essentially localized in regenerating nerves and pale cells, mostly contacting the central canal of the SC as typical Cerebrospinal-Fluid-Contacting-Neurons (CSFCNs). A smaller number of pale cells did not take up 3H-GABA and some of them appeared to be degenerating. Weaker radioactivity in regenerating SC was observed 6 hours post injection. Among non neural tissues, cells of the regenerating blastema, of the meninges and capillaries surrounding the regenerating SC, showed lower 3H-GABA uptake. This indicates that a certain amount of injected 3H-GABA has been converted to other metabolites. No 3H-GABA uptake was detected 1 or 6 hours post injection in normal SC and brain both in grey and white matter. This research indicates that CSFCNs of the regenerating tail in lizards uptake the aminoacid GABA or derived aminoacids, suggesting these cells subserve a high metabolic activity and may be GABA-ergic},

	Abstract = {The electroretinogram (ERG) was recorded from free-moving Anolis lizards once per hour for 5 days. As in our previous work, the b-wave, but not the a-wave, showed a reliable circadian rhythm (CR) in amplitude, with an acrophase near projected noon. Both the a- and b-waves showed a CR in peak time (implicit time, or IT), with the a-wave IT being longest near midnight, and the b-wave IT at midday. Acrophases were shifted when animals were housed on a phase-shifted light-dark cycle. The ERG CR was unaffected by removal of the parietal organ, but it was virtually abolished by removal of the pineal gland, thus suggesting that pineal output (probably melatonin) modulates retinal responses.

	Abstract = {A combined Golgi-impregnation/immunocytochemistry procedure was developed to identify the endogenous neurotransmitter content of morphologically characterized neurons. Golgi-impregnated retinal amacrine cells in the lizard Anolis carolinensis were characterized morphologically in thick resin sections. Cells of interest were remounted, resectioned at 1 micron thickness and subjected to a postembedding immunofluorescence procedure to visualize the amino acid neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine. Double-labeled cells were identified by opaque Golgi deposits in the cytoplasm under bright-field illumination and nuclear immunofluorescence under ultraviolet illumination. Twenty-seven Golgi-impregnated amacrine cells, exhibiting morphological features of GABA-immunoreactive (GABA-IR) cells, were tested for GABA-IR; 21 showed double labeling. Glycine-IR amacrine cells also were identified using the Golgi/immunocytochemistry procedure. This double-labeling procedure allows rapid assessment of endogenous neurotransmitter content in large samples of morphologically characterized neurons.},

	Abstract = {Arginine vasotocin (AVT) is a neuropeptide involved in reproductive function in many nonmammalian vertebrates. We determined brain and plasma AVT concentrations during the estrous cycle and oviposition in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. There were no differences in AVT concentrations in the plasma or any brain region during the ovipositional sequence. However, we found that females with an egg in each oviduct and a large pre-ovulatory follicle (diameter > 4.5 mm) in one-ovary had significantly higher AVT concentrations in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus than did females with small pre-ovulatory follicles in both ovaries. In a second study, females with an egg in each oviduct and a large pre-ovulatory follicle had significantly greater AVT concentrations in the SON than females with only one oviductal egg and a large pre-ovulatory follicle or females with an egg in each oviduct and a small pre-ovulatory follicle in each ovary. Concentrations of AVT in other brain regions and in the plasma did not differ among these groups. Changes in steroid profiles during estrous and/or direct neural communication between the uterus, ovary, and brain may account for the changes in AVT concentrations seen in the supraoptic nucleus during the estrous cycle of Anolis carolinensis.},

Unexpectedly, only vitamin A2-derived chromophore was detected in Anolis, while a mixture of vitamin A1- and vitamin A2-derived chromophores was detected in Podarcis. These are the first examples of fully terrestrial vertebrates using vitamin A2-derived chromophore for visual pigment generation.

Major catecholaminergic fibers, tracts and varicosities included tuberohypophysial, mesolimbic, nigrostriatal, isthmocortical, medullohypothalamic, and coeruleospinal systems. Although the catecholaminergic systems in A. carolinensis are similar to those in the brains of other lizards studied, there are a few species differences.

An analysis of melatonin receptor distribution in the lizard brain revealed an asymmetry of melatonin binding in the diencephalon. A high degree of melatonin binding was present in the left habenular nucleus, but no binding was observed in the habenulum of the right brain hemisphere. It is intriguing that the left habenular nucleus, in contrast to the right habenulum, both possesses a high density of melatonin receptors and receives primary photic input from the parietal eye. Similarly, the optic tectum, which receives primary visual input from the retina, is also rich in melatonin receptors. These observations suggest that the left habenulum is under dual control (neuronal and hormonal) of the parietal eye/pineal complex, and that melatonin may play a significant role in neural processing of visual information.},

	Abstract = {Immunocytochemical and autoradiographic methods were used to identify neurons in the pure cone retina of the lizard (Anolis carolinensis) that are likely to employ glutamate (GLU) or aspartate (ASP) as a neurotransmitter. GLU immunocytochemistry demonstrated high levels of endogenous GLU in all cone types and numerous bipolar cells. Moderate GLU levels were found in horizontal and ganglion cells. Muller cells and most amacrine cells had very low GLU levels. GLU immunoreactivity (GLU-IR) in the cones was present from the inner segment to the synaptic pedicle. A large spherical cell type with moderate GLU-IR was identified in the proximal inner plexiform layer (IPL). These cells also contain ASP and have been tentatively identified as amacrine cells. Uptake of [3H]-L-GLU labeled all retinal layers. All cone types and Muller cells sequestered [3H]-D-ASP, a substrate specific for the GLU transporter. Anti-ASP labeling was observed in cones, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and cells in the ganglion cell layer. ASP immunoreactivity (ASP-IR) in the cones was confined to the inner segment. One ASP-containing pyriform amacrine cell subtype ramifying in IPL sublamina b was identified. Analysis of GLU-IR, ASP-IR, and GABA-IR on serial sections indicated that there were two distinct populations of horizontal cells in the Anolis retina: one containing GABA-IR, GLU-IR, and ASP-IR; and another type containing only GLU-IR and ASP-IR. Light GLU-IR was frequently found in GABA-containing amacrine cells but ASP-IR was not. The distinct distributions of GLU and ASP may indicate distinctly different roles for these amino acids. GLU, not ASP, is probably the major neurotransmitter in the cone-bipolar-ganglion cell pathway of the Anolis retina. Both GLU and ASP are present in horizontal cells and specific subpopulations of amacrine cells, but it is unclear if GLU or ASP have a neurotransmitter role in these cells.},

Concurrently, it has recently been shown that injection of TRH induces skin darkening in the lizard Anolis carolinensis (Licht and Denver, 1988). In the present study, we have thus investigated in vitro the possible effect of TRH on alpha-MSH release from the lizard (Lacerta vivipara) neurointermediate lobe, by means of the perifusion technique. Using our radioimmunoassay procedure, we found that serial dilutions of L. vivipara NIL extracts and synthetic alpha-MSH gave parallel binding curves. Administration of graded doses of TRH (10(-8)-10(-6) M) did not cause any modification of alpha-MSH release. In contrast, infusion of a depolarizing concentration of K+ induced a robust stimulation of alpha-MSH secretion. These results indicate that, in the lizard L. vivipara, the neuropeptide TRH does not stimulate pituitary melanotrophs.},

Inhabiting all study plots, often in local abundance, L. trinidadensis emerged as the principal candidate sand fly vector; the results of surveys did not suggest a likely mosquito vector. Although L. trinidadensis and infected anoles co-inhabited all plots, their abundances seemed unrelated. No evidence that sand flies parasitized anoles was uncovered. As anole activity patterns in daylight reciprocate with those of sand flies and at night anoles seem to avoid locations that sand flies frequent, anoles may evade sand fly bites altogether. Further, these sand flies occurred in close numerical and ecological association with Thecadactylus rapicauda, a reclusive moist forest gecko, often parasitizing these hosts in large numbers. Thus, sand flies lack capacity as vectors of malaria-causing parasites in central Panamanian anoles.},

	Abstract = {The inhibitory amino-acid neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), was localized in the pure cone retina of the lizard Anolis carolinensis by autoradiographic and immunocytochemical techniques. Uptake of [3H]-GABA labeled horizontal cells, amacrine cells, numerous cells in the ganglion cell layer, both plexiform layers, and the nerve fiber layer. Label in the inner plexiform layer showed distinct lamination. The pattern of GABA immunoreactivity was similar to the pattern of [3H]-GABA uptake, although some differences, particularly in labeling of amacrine and ganglion cells, were observed. Immunocytochemistry revealed endogenous stores of GABA in a set of horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and cells in the ganglion cell layer. Both plexiform layers were labeled by the GABA antisera. Labeling in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) was highly stratified and GABA-immunoreactive strata were present in both sublaminae a and b. Six subtypes of conventionally placed GABA-immunoreactive amacrine cells and one displaced amacrine cell subtype were identified. Three of the six conventional amacrine cell subtypes were of pyriform morphology and three subtypes were of multipolar morphology. GABA-immunoreactive interstitial cells also were observed. Under certain conditions the GABA antiserum labeled the cones. Etching the resin eliminated cone labeling, suggesting that GABA in the cones is present in a labile pool, unlike GABA in horizontal or amacrine cells, or the observed labeling was not due to endogenous GABA. Cones did not demonstrate [3H]-GABA uptake.},

Methanol/acid extracts of whole brains obtained from each species were separately fractionated by gel filtration chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC. In all three species, an immunoreactive form of alpha-neo-endorphin was detected with the same retention time as synthetic mammalian alpha-neo-endorphin following reversed-phase HPLC analysis. In all three species, reversed-phase HPLC analysis revealed a novel form of dynorphin B(1-13)-related immunoreactivity. With the available immunological probes, dynorphin A products were only detected in the Anolis brain extracts. Both dynorphin A(1-17) and dynorphin A(1-8) were detected in this species.},

	Abstract = {We determined levels of monoamines and their metabolites in 2 hypothalami dissected from the right and left hemibrains of 15 females during the right-left alternating ovulatory cycle of Anolis carolinensis. Tissue contents of the following were measured using HPLC and electrochemical (coulometric) detection: dopamine (DA) and its metabolite 2,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), norepinephrine (NE) and its metabolites 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), and serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). An asymmetry ratio (AR) was determined by subtracting hypothalamic content (pM/mg) on the larger ovary (LO) side from that on the smaller ovary (SO) side, divided by the sum of the 2 sides (AR = SO - LO/SO+LO). The Ar of MHPG and DHPG both decreased as the largest follicle in the LO grew during the cycle, from greater than 0 (content higher on the SO side) at the beginning of the cycle to less than 0 (content higher on the LO side). The average content of MHPG in the 2 sides significantly increased during the cycle. There were no significant asymmetric changes in hypothalamic DA or DOPAC. The average content of DA increased during the cycle, whereas the content of DOPAC, as well as DOPAC/DA, did not change. The average content of 5-HT increased, and the average metabolite ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT decreased during the cycle without significant asymmetries. The metabolite ratios of NE and DA, but not 5-HT, were asymmetric on the same side in a given female.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The lizard Anolis carolinensis exhibits asymmetric ovarian growth. At any given time, the larger ovary (LO) contains a larger follicle than does the smaller ovary (SO). Physiologically hypophysectomized females with quiescent ovaries were treated with gonadotropin (ovine FSH) or saline vehicle after either surgical removal of the LO or sham operation. The smaller ovaries of initial control, sham-operated, and hemiovariectomized (HO) females were similar in weight and follicular size. Therefore, endogenous gonadotropin secretion remained at subthreshold levels during the experiment and after HO. FSH significantly stimulated ovarian follicular growth in both sham-operated and HO females. However, the response of the SO of HO females to FSH was significantly greater than that in sham-operated females. These results demonstrate a greater sensitivity of the SO to FSH if the LO is absent.},

	Abstract = {Two species of sand flies were collected by various methods from sites in the Dominican Republic. Lutzomyia cayennensis hispaniolae was the more common of the two. It was found in wooded habitats from sea level to an elevation of 442 m. This species was observed feeding on lizards (Anolis sp.) in the wild. In the laboratory, it fed only on lizards and only under lighted conditions. The other species, Lu. christophei was only found in the vicinity of seven leishmaniasis case sites. It readily fed on or probed rodents and humans. Although no naturally infected sand flies were collected, in the laboratory Lu. christophei was readily capable of transmitting the Dominican Leishmania parasite to uninfected BALB/c mice. We collected 167 specimens of three species of rodents and three Herpestes auropunctatus (mongoose) from the vicinity of two case sites. All four species are non-endemics introduced in post-Columbian times. Although we were unable to isolate parasites from any of these specimens, four of 44 Rattus rattus from one case site were seropositive for antibodies against Leishmania by indirect fluorescent antibody testing. This represents the first report of transmission of the Dominican Leishmania parasite by a sympatric species of sand fly and suggests that commensal rodents may play a role in the epidemiologic cycle.},

Incubation of the retina in N2 medium with hyaluronidase and DNAase allows us to obtain intact photoreceptors with good purity (85-90%), yields (greater than 2 x 10(5) cells per retina), and more than 95% of them excluding Trypan blue. cAMP levels are 20-fold higher than cGMP levels in cells from dark-adapted animals and are decreased by 35% upon exposure to light, whereas cGMP levels show no apparent change. However, both cAMP- and cGMP-phosphodiesterases, as well as adenylate and guanylate cyclase, are activated several-fold by light, but the enzymes involved in cGMP metabolism have higher Vmaxs than the cAMP related enzymes. The apparent constant levels of cGMP found in cone photoreceptors may result from our inability to detect the very fast changes that occur in these cells when they are exposed to light.},

	Abstract = {H3-thymidine was injected in a single dose into adult lizards Anolis carolinensis during early stages of tail regeneration when the new tail measured in length 2-5 mm (about 3 weeks). Electron microscopic autoradiography revealed that in the regenerating spinal cord three different cell types were recognizable four hours post-injection. By far the most common type was the ependymal cell. Ependymal or roundish cells with clear electron-density or storing bundles of intermediate filaments were occasionally found. A second rarer, cell type devoid of intermediate filaments was a pale round cell, often highly labelled. This cell showed a very poor ultrastructural differentiation and probably represents the precursor of the few neurons and glial cells observed in older stages of regeneration. The third type was a neuroblast at different degrees of differentiation and did not uptake H3-thymidine revealing it was a post-mitotic cell. Despite the relatively advanced ultrastructural differentiation of these neurons, synapses were rarely seen after three weeks of SC regeneration in Anolis.},

Dewlap extension is accomplished by the contraction of ceratohyoid muscles associated with the hyoid apparatus. Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to investigate the brainstem origins of efferent fibers to the ceratohyoid muscles in Anolis equestris. Following application of HRP to the ceratohyoid muscle or to its nerve supply on one side of the throat, large polygonal motoneurons were found ipsilaterally in the vagal (Amb X) and glossopharyngeal (Amb IX) parts of nucleus ambiguus. Labelled neurons were more abundant and more heavily labelled in Amb X than in Amb IX. In addition, small spindle-shaped cells were labelled ipsilaterally in three parasympathetic nuclei that innervate glandular structures in the pharyngeal floor. HRP injections of the larynx labelled cells in many of the same locations, including Amb X and Amb IX. Thus, the nucleus ambiguus in Anolis contains motoneurons for supply of striated muscles in the hyoid (i.e. ceratohyoid muscles) and the larynx.},

Tryptic peptide analysis indicated that the [3H]Trp-labeled C-terminal fragment of Anolis alpha-MSH had the same retention time as mammalian ACTH(9-13) amide; however, the [3H]Tyr-labeled N-terminal fragment did not coelute with either mammalian ACTH(1-8) or N-acetyl-ACTH(1-8). Purification of alpha-MSH from 76 Anolis intermediate pituitaries confirmed that a sequence change had occurred in the N-terminal region of Anolis alpha-MSH. The tissues were acid extracted and purified by Sephadex G-25 chromatography and reverse phase HPLC to yield 4.5 micrograms of purified Anolis alpha-MSH for amino acid composition analysis and automated Edman degradation sequence analysis. The major form of Anolis alpha-MSH is nonacetylated and has the following novel primary sequence: Ser-Tyr-Ala-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro(Val-amide).

	Abstract = {Vitellogenin (VTG) synthesis has been described as an ideal system to study the hormonal regulation of gene expression. In Xenopus the molecular aspects of this control have been analyzed; however, in other non-mammalian species such as reptiles, very few studies approaching this level have been undertaken. We report on the induction by estradiol-17 beta of VTG-like proteins in liver explants from adult males and immature male and female lizards (A. pulchellus). A concentration of 10(-7) M was optimum for adult males while a higher concentration (10(-6) M) is required for the immature animals. No differences were observed in the hormonal induction in male and female immature animals, suggesting that there are no sexual distinctions in the liver at this stage. The effect of the hormone in male liver appears to be primarily on mRNA synthesis, since increases in 3H-uridine incorporation in total RNA were prevented by addition of 1 microgram/ml of the RNA polymerase II inhibitor alpha-Amanitin; however, rRNA synthesis was also increased as observed by agarose gel analysis. A 48 hr lag period was required for the detection of the intracellular as well as the secreted VTG-like protein. Electrophoretical analysis of the secretory products revealed the induction of a group of phosphoproteins immunologically related to yolk lipovitellin whose molecular weights range from 116,000 to 200,000.},

@article{Grace:1991aa,
	Abstract = {Deacetylation is a rapid clearance mechanism for ocular melatonin. We have studied the distribution of retinal melatonin deacetylase activity among vertebrate classes. Exogenous radiolabeled melatonin is metabolized by ocular tissue prepared from the amphibian Xenopus laevis, the reptile Anolis carolinensis, the teleost fish Carassius auratus, and the bird Gallus domesticus. In contrast, we were unable to detect ocular melatonin breakdown in rat or pig. In each species exhibiting ocular melatonin breakdown, melatonin is first deacetylated to 5-methoxytryptamine, which is deaminated, producing 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol. Deacetylation of melatonin is inhibited by eserine (physostigmine), causing a reduction in the levels of all 3 metabolites. Deamination of 5-methoxytryptamine is inhibited by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor pargyline, such that 5-methoxyindoleacetic acid and 5-methoxytryptophol levels are decreased while levels of 5-methoxytryptamine are increased. Incubation with the deacetylase inhibitor eserine increases endogenous melatonin levels in Xenopus and Carassius eyecups, indicating that endogenous melatonin is metabolized via the deacetylase. We also studied the tissue distribution of the deacetylase in Xenopus laevis. Melatonin deacetylation occurs in retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and skin, all of which are sites of melatonin action. These results indicate that among non-mammalian vertebrates, deacetylation is a common clearance mechanism for ocular melatonin, and may degrade melatonin at other sites of action as well. Melatonin deacetylation may help regulate local melatonin concentration, and generates other biologically active methoxyindoles.},

However, mortalities and morbidity were high in the Culex which had fed on the Coluber. Oocysts were not found in any Ornithodoros turicata (Argasidae) which fed upon either snake host, but many sections of fed ticks had gametocyte-like cells within the gut lumen. Most lizards, Anolis carolinensis and Anolis sagrei, infected per os with oocysts derived from both snake species developed infections. Infections in the lizards were largely confined to hepatic schizonts with few parasites found in erythrocytes. Unlike naturally infected snake hosts, Hepatozoon schizonts in livers of lizards were often either surrounded by an unidentified dark pigment or heavily infiltrated with mononuclear inflammatory cells.},

	Abstract = {Cone and rod photoreceptors utilize cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the light regulation of membrane polarization. The prototype for visual transduction is established for rod photoreceptors, which utilize a cascade of reactions to regulate a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) (EC 3.1.4.17) and thereby control the intracellular concentration of cGMP. Although cones appear to utilize a comparable cGMP cascade for their phototransduction, evidence exists that the PDE from cone photoreceptors may be different from that of rods. Dissociated cone photoreceptors, isolated retinas, and cone outer segments from the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, have been used to identify and characterize a PDE enzyme complex that shares several features in common with the rod outer segment (ROS) PDE complex. Immunoadsorption and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have identified a subunit of lizard cone PDE that has an apparent electrophoretic mobility of 84 kDa and a subunit of lizard rod PDE that migrates at approximately 90 kDa. The lizard cone PDE complex is similar in size, extraction, activation, and immunological characteristics to the PDE complex of rod photoreceptors from lizard, bovine, and human retinas. The lizard cone PDE complex, and perhaps that from cone photoreceptors in general, differs from that of ROS in its chromatographic properties on anion-exchange resins. The sharing of physical and activation properties of the rod and cone PDE complex is compatible with the phototransduction process occurring by a similar mechanism in both cell types. The differences in light sensitivity and speed of response may be attributable to features of the individual proteins that form the PDE complexes of rods and cones or to other undisclosed features of the respective cascades.},

	Abstract = {Proximate constraints on egg size, number, and total clutch mass in side-blotched lizards were examined by experimentally reducing average clutch size from 4.6 eggs to one, two, and three eggs. Eggs from experimentally altered clutches were larger than those from controls, reflecting the trade-off between egg size and number. Moreover, the increased frequency of females with oviducally bound eggs or eggs that burst at oviposition suggests that egg size in clutches with very few eggs are at a functional upper size limit. These proximate constraints may also limit evolution of egg size in another group of lizards (Anolis) that only produces one-egged clutches.},

	Abstract = {That portion of the dorsal surface of the tongue of Anolis carolinensis that is covered by plumose papillae is underlaid by a series of tubular salivary glands that open between the papillae; glands persist into the posterior zone of the tongue, where they open between cylindriform papillae. Anterior glands are serous in nature--they consist of simple columnar epithelial cells that contain abundant secretory granules exhibiting a variety of substructural patterns. The Golgi apparatus is large and of unusual appearance, with numerous closely packed terminal dilatations and condensing vacuoles. Near the posterior border of the lingual zone covered by plumose papillae, mucous cells begin to appear in the glandular epithelium. More posteriorly, the apical portions of the glands consist entirely of mucous cells, whereas the blind ends of the glands are composed of serous cells. The most posterior glands are of the pure mucous variety. The glands finally disappear a short distance posterior to the cylindriform papillae. The functions of the abundant and highly differentiated salivary glands of the Anolis tongue remain obscure.},

	Abstract = {1. Three size-classes of vitellogenin polypeptides were detected by electrophoretic and radiolabeling techniques in 32Pi-labeled plasma of vitellogenic female lizards but not in male animals. Based on their apparent Mr, the polypeptides were designated as VTG-226-201K, VTG-169-153K and VTG-116-123K. 2. Structural differences were found between VTG-169-153K and VTG-116K by partial proteolysis with S. aureus V8 protease and radiolabeling techniques. 3. Autoradiography of a 3-10% native gradient gel revealed three different species of VTG in 32Pi-labeled plasma of stimulated males: VTG-I (Mr = 850,000), VTG-II (Mr = 750,000) and VTG-III (Mr = 610,000). By 2D PAGE, it was shown that VTG-169K and VTG-116K are components of VTG-I, while VTG-153K and VTG-116K comprise VTG-III. These results suggest an oligomeric structure for native VTG. 4. Amino acid analysis, 32Pi incorporation, electrophoretical behavior and Mr estimation demonstrated homology between VTG-116K and the S1-lipovitellin from the lizard egg. 5. These results strongly indicate an unusual multiplicity of VTG forms in tropical lizards when compared to other egg-laying vertebrates.},

The imaging system consisted of a Sarastro Phoibos 1000 (Molecular Dynamics) scanning system and a Zeiss Universal microscope. The data were analyzed using the VANIS set of programs on a Silicon Graphics Personal Iris computer. A three dimensional reconstruction of the nerve terminals was performed using look-through and depth-coded projections. The volume of the nerve terminal was estimated in 15 neuromuscular junctions and found to be 84,835 microns 3 (+/- 8558 SEM). The largest diameter in each one of the 178 individual boutons was estimated from the look-through projections of 17 nerve terminals in 9 preparations. It was found to be 4.71 microns (+/- 0.08 SEM). The diameter perpendicular to the largest diameter in the same projection at 0 degrees was 3.3 microns (+/- 0.054 SEM). Thus it seems that the synaptic boutons of the ceratomandibularis are suitable for combined optical and electrophysiological recordings.},

	Abstract = {Three different monoiodinated radioligands of alpha-MSH (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone) were compared in a binding assay with human D10 melanoma cells: [Tyr(125I)2]-alpha-MSH, [Tyr(125I)2,NIe4]-alpha-MSH, and [Tyr(125I)2,NIe4,D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH. They were prepared either by the classical chloramine T method or by the Enzymobead method. A simple and rapid purification scheme was developed consisting of a primary separation on reversed-phase C18 silica cartridges immediately after the iodination, followed by HPLC purification before each binding experiment. Biological testing of the three radioligands showed that they all retained high melanotropic activity in the B16 melanin assay and the Anolis melanophore assay. However, in human D10 melanoma cells, [Tyr(125I)2,NIe4]-alpha-MSH led to a high degree of non-specific binding to the cells which could not be displaced by excess alpha-MSH and only partially by [NIe4]-alpha-MSH. The [Tyr(125I)2,NIe4,D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH tracer gave similar results but with a much lower proportion of non-specific binding. On the other hand, [Tyr(125I)2]-alpha-MSH proved to be an excellent radioligand whose non-specific binding to the D10 cells was not higher than 20% of the total binding.},

	Abstract = {The dewlap is an extendible flap of skin ordinarily folded under the throat. Lizards, particularly those in the genus Anolis, extend their dewlaps during interactions with conspecifics, other lizards, and potential predators. Dewlap extension is effected by movements of elements of the hyoid apparatus. This paper describes the anatomy of the hyoid and associated musculature in Anolis equestris, a large arboreal lizard with a prominent dewlap. A mechanism for dewlap extension is proposed based on results of morphological and experimental techniques. Specializations of the hyoid skeleton for dewlap extension include elongated second ceratobranchials and highly movable joints between the ceratohyals and the hypohyals and between the first ceratobranchials and the body of the hyoid. A well developed M. ceratohyoideus extends between the ceratohyals and the first ceratobranchials of the hyoid apparatus. During dewlap extension, the hyoid apparatus acts as a first order lever. Contraction of M. ceratohyoideus pulls the ceratohyals posteriorly causing the hypohyals and the body of the hyoid to rotate dorsally around the first ceratobranchial/body joints. This movement results in the second ceratobranchials swinging forward and down, unfolding the dewlap. The relative immobility of the first ceratobranchials provides stability to the hyoid apparatus during dewlap extension. A comparison is made of dewlap extension and other hyoid displays.},

Radiommunoassay of 0.1 N HCl extracts of Chrysemys bladder indicated an immunoreactive NT (iNT) concentration of 161 +/- 39 pmol/g tissue (n = 9), an amount lower but comparable in magnitude to that found in mucosal scrapings of the intestine (926 +/- 125 pmol/g, n = 9). Bladder and intestinal iNT were indistinguishable during chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and HPLC on mu-Bondapak C18 where they eluted at the same position as avian NT. Similar results were obtained by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay of urinary bladders from Pseudemys scripta scripta, P. scripta elegans, and P. floridana, three emydid species closely related to C. picta, but not from Sternotherus odoratus and Trionyx spinifer asper, representatives of the families Kinosternidae and Trionychidae, respectively, although positive results were obtained with intestinal preparations from these species. NT cells were not seen in urinary bladder from Rana pipiens, Bufo marinus, Necturus maculosus, or Anolis carolinensis. Thus, the presence of NT-containing cells in urinary bladder is not common among subavian vertebrates and may even be restricted to the Emydidae family of chelonians.},

	Abstract = {Adult males of the small arboreal iguanid lizard, Anolis carolinensis, will fight and form social dominance hierarchies when placed in habitats with limited resources. The relationships between time since initial aggressive interaction, relative social dominance, reproductive activity, and corticosterone and androgen levels were determined for 34 pairs of lizards. A discriminant analysis established a "dominance index" which indicated that over 90% of the difference between individuals who had won or lost aggressive interactions (putative social dominants and subordinates) was attributable to a single discriminant function reflecting altered body color, perch site selection, and circulating androgen. Animals that had darker body color also selected lower perch sites and had depressed rates of courtship relative to winners of fights and were thus designated as social subordinates. These animals also had levels of circulating androgen significantly lower than that of dominants, but circulating corticosterone was not significantly affected. Winners of fights showed a dramatic surge in circulating androgen at 1 hr but returned to near control values by 1 week; losers, however, showed depressed circulating androgen levels at 1 week.},

To test the possible role of hypothalamic function in ovarian asymmetry, we measured levels of 3 major monoamine neurotransmitters (norepinephrine; dopamine; serotonin) and their metabolites in microdissected left and right diencephalon from lizards during the first cycle of ovulation in the spring. All of the metabolite/parent neurotransmitter ratios were significantly higher on the side of the diencephalon ipsilateral to the quiescent ovary than on the side of the maturing ovary. Simultaneous ovarian and brain asymmetry suggests direct communication between the ovary and brain, presumably through the ovarian innervation.},

	Abstract = {Over 90{\%} of the Sertoli cells in the testes of adult lizards (Anolis carolinensis) are binucleate. The nuclei occur in closely associated pairs in the basal cytoplasm of the Sertoli cells that line the testis tubules. The two nuclei of a pair are of similar volume, and each usually contains one conspicuous rounded nucleolus. The average volume of individual nuclei varies from 367.8 microm(3) in spermatogenically active testes in March to 172.5 microm(3) in September, when testes are regressed. The irregular shape of the Sertoli nuclei is particularly pronounced during testicular regression. Until initiation of spermatogenesis in hatchling lizards, Sertoli cells have a single nucleus containing patches of hetcrochromatin. With the appearance of prophase stages of primary spermatocytes, a few paired Sertoli nuclei can be found, and the nuclei increasingly exhibit the homogeneous euchromatic nucleoplasm of the adult. The average volume of individual nuclei in lizards under 4 months of age is less than a third the volume of Sertoli nuclei in reproductively active adults. The appearance of binucleate cells at this time documents a doubling of the amount of desoxynucleic acid in Sertoli cells preparatory to their growth and expanded functions during spermatogenesis.},

Control measurements for mild laboratory manipulation (such as the movement of a metabolic chamber) yielded significant increases in the rate of oxygen consumption, but not in the lactate concentration of these animals; stronger manipulation increased both. A possible influence of conspecific olfactory cues on the metabolism of lizards introduced into empty chambers was undetected. Anolis that turned from green to brown with handling showed an increase in oxygen uptake, but an association between this color shift and total body lactate level was not detected. Elevated rates of oxygen use and glycolysis were found in pairs of males in the absence of physical activity. Lactate levels of the individuals of a pair were positively correlated with one another; the lactate concentrations of lizards placed into occupied metabolic chambers were correlated with the difference in body mass of the pair.},

	Abstract = {Utilizing results from previous structure-activity relationships and theoretical studies of alpha-melanotropin (alpha-MSH, Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2) and its related superpotent analogues, Ac-[Nle4,D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH and Ac-[Cys4,Cys10]-alpha-MSH, we have designed a new class of alpha-MSH4-13 and alpha-MSH4-10 cyclic lactam fragment analogues of alpha-melanotropin. The cyclic peptides have the following general structures: Ac-[Nle4,Xxx5,D-Phe7,Yyy10,Gly11]-alpha-MSH4-13- NH2 and Ac-[Nle4,Xxx5,D-Phe7,Yyy10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2, where Xxx = Glu or Asp and Yyy = Lys, Orn, Dab, or Dpr. Formation of the lactam bridge between the side-chain groups Xxx and Yyy was performed either in solution or on a solid-phase support. Seven cyclic peptides were prepared and bioassayed for their melanotropic potency by using standard frog (Rana pipiens) and lizard (Anolis carolinensis) skin bioassays. Relative to alpha-MSH (relative potency = 1), the potencies of the cyclic peptides in the lizard skin bioassay were as follows: alpha-MSH (1); Ac-[Nle4,Glu5,D-Phe7,Lys10,Gly11]-alpha-MSH4-13- NH2 (6); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Lys10,Gly11]-alpha-MSH4-13- NH2 (100); Ac-[Nle4,Glu5,D-Phe7,Lys10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (9); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Lys10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (90); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Orn10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (20); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Dab10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (5); Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Dpr10]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 (5). Similar results were obtained in the frog skin bioassay, but the analogues were much less potent. Cyclic melanotropins with 23-membered rings exhibited 100-fold higher melanotropic potency than alpha-MSH with selectivity for the lizard melanocyte receptors over the frog melanocyte receptors. Increasing or decreasing the ring size of these cyclic melanotropins from 23 diminishes the biological potency of the resulting cyclic peptide. The 23- and 24-membered ring analogues showed prolonged (residual) biological activities in both biological assays, but the smaller ring systems (20, 21, 22) did not. These results provide new insights into the structural and conformational requirements of alpha-MSH and its analogues at two different types of pigment cell (melanocyte) receptors.},

Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry using immunogold and avidin/biotin-peroxidase techniques showed that 20 93 antigen is localized to the paraboloid, a region specifically involved in glycogen metabolism in cones. In addition, a few bipolar cells were found to be labeled. The monoclonal antibody showed limited species cross-reactivity and failed to stain mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cow, Anolis, and human retinas. Immunoblotting showed that monoclonal antibody 20-93 binds to a 40 KDa protein that is present in the retinal membrane.

They revealed that while Na+ channels are the major ionic current pathway in the heminode, K+ channels provide the major pathway in the terminal branches and boutons. 3. Calcium current in the presynaptic ending was unmasked by the application of tetraethylammonium (TEA). This current was blocked by: (a) cadmium, (b) omega-conotoxin GVIA and (c) nifedipine, but was unaffected by nickel at concentrations less than or equal to 100 microM. Nifedipine's action became more definitive when the duration of the action potential was greatly extended by pre-treatment with TEA. The effect of Bay K 8644 was inconsistent. 4. Transmitter release, as measured by postsynaptic current, had a pharmacological response profile similar to that of the Ca2+ current, with the exception that transmitter release was increased reliably and reversibly by Bay K 8644. 5. This pharmacological response profile is identical to that of the L type Ca2+ channel identified by Fox, Nowycky & Tsien (1987 alpha) in chick dorsal root ganglion neurones. We saw no evidence for more than a single type of Ca2+ channel in lizard motor nerve endings. 6. A calcium-activated K+ current IK(Ca) was revealed by application of 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP), a delayed-rectifier K+ channel blocker. This K(Ca) current was blocked by TEA, charybdotoxin and by substitution of cobalt for extracellular calcium.},

	Abstract = {Saurian malaria parasites in the Caribbean were previously represented by only two species, Plasmodium azurophilum and P. floridense. An additional three species of Plasmodium occur on Hispaniola which appear, because of morphometric and qualitative similarities, to be related to South and Middle American species: a subspecies of Plasmodium tropiduri in Anolis cybotes; a population of Plasmodium minasense anolisi in A. cybotes and A. distichus; and another parasite in A. distichus which is designated as a subspecies of a previously undescribed Plasmodium species in Anolis limifrons. Taxonomic descriptions based upon morphology of mature schizonts and gametocytes are given, the previously unknown parasites are described as new species/subspecies, and comparison is made with P. floridense which also occurs in their respective host species. A Fallisia species was also present but is not described. The increased diversity of Plasmodium parasites in Hispaniolan anoles is attributed to colonization of the island by four separate evolutionary lines of Anolis lizards, in comparison to fewer invasions of Jamaica and Puerto Rico, where only P. floridense and P. azurophilum are found.},

The minimal sequence of alpha-MSH required for agonism in the lizard (Anolis carolinensis) skin bioassay was determined to be Ac-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-NH2 (Ac-alpha-MSH6-9-NH2). Smaller fragments of this sequence (Ac-alpha-MSH6-8-NH2, Ac-alpha-MSH6-7-NH2, Ac-alpha-MSH7-9-NH2, and Ac-alpha-MSH7-8-NH2) were devoid of melanotropic activity. The tetrapeptide, Ac-alpha-MSH7-10-NH2, was also inactive, thus again demonstrating the importance of His at position 6 for minimal activity. The important potentiating amino acids were found to be Met-4, Lys-11, and Pro-12, since Ac-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 was about 100 times more potent than Ac-alpha-MSH5-10-NH2, and Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 was about 40 times more potent than Ac-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 or Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2. Ac-alpha-MSH4-12-NH2 and Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-12-NH2 were equipotent and about six times more potent than alpha-MSH. Since [Nle4]-alpha-MSH and Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-13-NH2 were both equipotent but about sixfold less active than Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-12-NH2, it is clear that valine at position 13 does not contribute to the potency of alpha-MSH, except possibly in a negative way. The minimal message sequence for equipotency to alpha-MSH appears to be Ac-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-NH2, since the analog, Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2, was as active as the native hormone. Ser-1, Tyr-2, Ser-3, Glu-5, and Val-13 are not important for melanotropic potency since Ac-alpha-MSH4-12-NH2 was more potent than alpha-MSH, and Ac-alpha-MSH5-10-NH2 and Ac-alpha-MSH6-10-NH2 were equipotent, being about 4,000 times less active than alpha-MSH.},

	Abstract = {alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is a linear tridecapeptide (Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2) that has diverse physiological functions in addition to its reversible darkening of amphibian skins by stimulating melanosome dispersion within melanophores. On the basis of theoretical and experimental results from our laboratory and others, we have designed a group of 1-13, 4-13, and especially 4-10 analogues related to the superpotent analogue [Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH in which the Glu5 has been replaced with Asp5, and the Gly10 has been replaced with Lys10 and other basic amino acid residues in the 4-10 analogues, and in which Gly10 and Lys11 were interchanged in the longer peptide analogues. In the 1-13 and 4-13 series the Lys10, Gly11 analogues generally retained superpotency for the D-Phe7-containing analogues. Most interestingly, synthesis of Ac-[Nle4,Xxx5,Yyy7,Zzz10]alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 analogues where Xxx = Asp or Glu, Yyy = Phe or D-Phe, and Zzz = basic amino acids (Lys, Orn, alpha,gamma-diaminobutyric acid (Dab), and alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid (Dpr] provided melanotropins with potencies up to 10 times that of the native hormone in stimulating frog (Rana pipiens) skin darkening and 8-50 times more potent than alpha-MSH in stimulating lizard (Anolis carolinensis) skin melanophores in vitro. To our knowledge, Ac-[Nle4,Asp5,D-Phe7,Dab10]alpha-MSH4-10-NH2, the most potent analogue, is the most potent melanotropin obtained thus far for the Anolis assay system. These results provide new insights into the structural and conformational requirements for biological potency of alpha-MSH and the differential structural and conformational requirements of alpha-MSH and its analogues at two different types of pigment cell receptors.},

	Abstract = {Although much is known about morphological changes in the apex of the mammalian ovarian follicle prior to its rupture (ovulation), information about this process in nonmammalian vertebrates is limited to only a few species. We describe here the histological changes in the stigma of the lizard (Anolis carolinensis) ovarian follicle preceding FSH-induced ovulation. Females with a large vitellogenic follicle received two injections, separated by 7 hr, of either porcine FSH (25 micrograms) or saline, and then were sampled at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 hr after the first injection. Thus, all but the 6-hr group received two injections. By 12 hr, about half of the FSH-treated females had ovulated, and most had ovulated by 15 hr. In contrast, only 1 of 40 control females ovulated. Large unovulated follicles were fixed and bisected through the circular stigma; one hemisphere was embedded in paraffin and stained with Mallory's trichrome, and the other was embedded in plastic and stained with toluidine blue. FSH treatment produced marked histological changes in the stigma region, as well as alterations in nonstigmal areas of the follicle. The membrana granulosa of control follicles consisted of a single layer of squamous, darkly staining granulosa cells. After FSH treatment, nonstigmal granulosa cells separated slightly, and their nuclei became more clear and assumed an oval shape; in the stigma, these cells became widely separated, with round, light-staining nuclei containing one or two prominent nucleoli. The nonstigmal theca of FSH-treated follicles was similar to that of control follicles except that collagen fibers were more dissociated. In the stigma, collagen fibers were widely dissociated, and the theca swelled, presumably due to accumulation of extracellular fluid. Abundant fluid accumulated in the stigma, especially between the granulosa cells and their basement membrane and between the tunica albuginea and the theca externa. These changes in the lizard stigma are similar to those reported in mammals except that no marked inflammatory response occurs in the lizard stigma. We hypothesize that the Anolis follicle undergoes preovulatory luteinization, and that the stigma exhibits ischemic necrosis before rupture.},

The melanotropin activities of these two analogues were examined and compared relative to those of alpha-MSH, Ac-[Nle4]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2, and Ac-[Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2. In the frog (Rana pipiens) skin bioassay, the L-Phe7 17-membered ring cyclic analogue was slightly more potent than the linear Ac-[Nle4]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 and exhibited prolonged melanotropic bioactivity (greater than or equal to 4 h). In this same assay, the D-Phe7 cyclic analogue was more than 100-fold less potent than the L-Phe cyclic analogue and was 10,000 times less potent than linear Ac-[Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2. In the lizard skin (Anolis carolinensis) bioassay, the L-Phe7 cyclic analogue was 100-fold less potent than Ac-[Nle4]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2, while the D-Phe7 cyclic analogue was 10,000-fold less potent than both Ac-[Nle4]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 and the D-Phe7 linear derivative Ac-[Nle4,D-Phe7]alpha-MSH4-11-NH2. The solution conformation of these two cyclic analogues in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 was examined by 1D and 2D 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. Our analysis suggests an H bond stabilized C10 (or C13) turn for the D-Phe7 cyclic structure while the L-Phe7 analogue is more conformationally flexible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {The ability of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) to stimulate thyrotropin (TSH) from pituitaries of adult male lizards, Anolis carolinensis, was tested in vivo and in vitro. TSH output by pituitaries in vitro was determined by bioassay of the incubation medium using in vitro T4 output by thyroids from the same lizards. Pituitaries incubated without TRH had no detectable TSH secretion during two consecutive (2 or 3 hr) periods of incubation. Incubation in 10 or 100 ng/ml TRH for 2 or 3 hr significantly augmented release of TSH bioactivity in a dose-dependent manner. Pituitaries taken from goitrogen (100 micrograms methimazole/day for 10 days)-treated lizards had elevated basal TSH secretion but did not respond to TRH. TRH injection in vivo (5 micrograms/hr for 10 hr) appeared to stimulate acute release of MSH activity as judged by darkening of skin color after each injection, and plasma T4 was significantly elevated at the end of treatment. These results provide additional evidence that the reptilian thyrotrope has functional TRH receptors and the TSH-stimulating activity of the tripeptide along with its effects on other pituitary cells was present at an early stage of reptilian evolution.},

We predict properties of the parasite distribution in the absence of density-dependent factors such as density-dependent mortality of recruitment and parasite-induced host mortality. These properties provide a criterion for the detection of density dependence in temporally variable systems with host-age dependent interactions. We have then introduced methods to estimate and statistically evaluate the effects of host age or size on the distribution of parasites/host. The methods are based on a maximum likelihood protocol for linear and non-linear regression when data are negatively binomially distributed. We have illustrated the use of the theoretical results and statistical methods by re-analysing the data of Halvorsen & Andersen (1984) on cestode infections in Norwegian arctic charr and by analysing new data on nematode infections in Caribbean Anolis lizards.},

Extensive similarities in the banding patterns of the proteins were found. S antigen, serum albumin and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) were identified immunochemically. The latter two proteins dominate the IPM obtained from the apical surface of the retinal pigment epithelium, whereas IPM prepared from the retina washes contains IRBP plus outer-segment components including S antigen. IRBP is present in IPM from the all-cone lizard (Anolis) eye, as well as from rod- and cone-dominant animals. The ontogeny of IRBP in chick IPM is different from that of serum albumin in age of onset and rapidity of development. Comparison between Royal College of Surgeons rat IPM and normal rat IPM showed that several proteins are changed in amount. This study is a step toward a functional characterization of components common to the IPM of all vertebrates.},

	Abstract = {A radioreceptor assay for alpha-MSH is described which is based on cultured mouse B16 melanoma cells and bioactive monoiodinated [Nle4]-alpha-MSH tracer. The assay was used (1) to study the binding characteristics of alpha-MSH to B16 cells, (2) to determine the relative binding activity of MSH peptides, and (3) to measure MSH in tissue extracts. The association of alpha-MSH to B16 cells reached a stable plateau after 3 h at 15 degrees C. At 25 degrees or 37 degrees C, the binding was transient and at 0-1 degree C, the association was very slow. The hormone-receptor complex was relatively stable between 0 degrees and 15 degrees C whereas a 50% dissociation was reached after 90 min at 25 degrees C and after 35 min at 37 degrees C. The mean KD for alpha-MSH of four saturation experiments was 1.3 nM and the number of receptors 9570 per cell. 1,10-Phenanthroline had a stabilizing effect in the binding assay when used at a 0.3 mM concentration. From the MSH peptides tested in the binding assay, some showed similar potencies in three bioassays (tyrosinase, melanin and Anolis skin), whereas others displayed considerably lower bioassay values than expected from the binding data. This shows that binding and bioactivity can be dissociated in some of the MSH peptides. The biological activity of MSH from the neurointermediate lobe of the rat pituitary as measured by its binding to B16 cells corresponds fairly well with RIA results; in the anterior lobe, alpha-MSH values are overestimated because of the large amount of ACTH present.},

	Abstract = {1. The thermal dependence of passive electrical properties was determined for twitch fibres from the white region of the iliofibularis (IF) muscle of Anolis cristatellus (15-35 degrees C) and Sceloporus occidentalis (15-40 degrees C), and for twitch fibres from the white (15-45 degrees C) and red (15-40 degrees C) regions of the IF of Dipsosaurus dorsalis. These species differ in thermal ecology, with Anolis being the least thermophilic and Dipsosaurus the most thermophilic. 2. Iliofibularis fibres from the three species reacted similarly to changing temperature. As temperature was increased, input resistance (Rin) decreased (average R10 = 0.7), length constant (L) decreased (average R10 = 0.9), time constant (tau) decreased (average R10 = 0.8), sarcoplasmic resistivity (Rs) decreased (average R10 = 0.8) and apparent membrane resistance (Rm) decreased (average R10 = 0.7). In contrast, apparent membrane capacitance (Cm) increased with increasing temperature (average R10 = 1.3). 3. Rin, L, tau and apparent Rm were lowest in fibres from Anolis (the least thermophilic species) and highest in fibres from Dipsosaurus (the most thermophilic species). Anolis had the largest and Dipsosaurus the smallest diameter fibres (126 and 57 micron, respectively). Apparent Cm was highest in fibres from Sceloporus, which had fibres of intermediate diameter (101 micron). Rs did not differ significantly among species. 4. The effect of temperature on the passive electrical properties of these lizard fibres was similar to that reported for muscle fibres from other ectothermic animals (crustaceans, insects, fish and amphibians) but qualitatively different from that reported for some mammalian (cat tenuissimus, goat intercostal) fibres. The changes that occur in the passive electrical properties render the fibres less excitable as temperature increases.},

	Abstract = {The steady-state levels of alpha-melanotropin-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH)-related peptides were examined in the pars intermedia of the reptile Anolis carolinensis as a function of background adaptation. After a 7-day period, the content of immunoreactive alpha-MSH-related material in the pars intermedia of light-adapted animals was approximately fourfold higher than that of animals maintained on a dark background for the same period. The immunoreactive alpha-MSH-related material present in the pars intermedia of light-adapted and dark-adapted animals was separately analyzed by gel filtration chromatography, reverse-phase HPLC, and cation-exchange chromatography. For light-adapted animals the major form of alpha-MSH had an apparent molecular weight of 1.5 kDa and a net charge of +4 at pH 3.5. Following reverse-phase HPLC this material eluted as a single peak of immunoreactivity with a retention time distinct from that of both mammalian ACTH(1-13)amide and N-acetyl-ACTH(1-13)amide. For dark-adapted animals a peak of alpha-MSH-sized material with an apparent molecular weight of 1.5 kDa was also detected. Following reverse-phase HPLC analysis this material eluted as an apparent single peak of immunoreactivity with a retention time distinct from that of the mammalian standards. Subsequent analysis of this major HPLC peak by cation-exchange chromatography revealed the presence of at least two forms of immunoreactive alpha-MSH. These forms differed in relative proportions. The major peak of immunoreactivity had a net charge of +4, whereas the minor peak had a net charge of +3. The +3 immunoreactive form was not detected to any appreciable degree in light-adapted animals.},

	Abstract = {Social dominance in several species of lizards appears related to adrenal gland activity. The purpose of this study was to test whether the adrenal hormone corticosterone (CS) would inhibit the aggressive behavior of males of the lizard Anolis sagrei. Reproductively active males were randomly assigned to either CS or placebo (P) treatment groups or to an untreated stimulus male group. Both CS and P were administered in pellet form. Corticosterone pellets were designed to release approximately 4.8 micrograms of CS/day. Initially (Day 1), treatment males were implanted subcutaneously with a single pellet of either CS or P. After 1 week (Day 8), behavior tests were staged between treatment males and untreated stimulus males. The behavior of treatment males in response to stimulus males was videotaped. Significantly fewer CS-treated males than P-treated males approached the stimulus males, erected a crest, or showed biting behavior. Corticosterone-treated males also displayed significantly less frequently than did P-treated males and gave fewer displays of a type associated with dominance. Mean combined testis weight at the end of the experiment was significantly less in CS-treated males than in P-treated males and spermatogenic activity in CS-treated males was reduced. Plasma testosterone in CS-treated males was nondetectable, whereas P-treated males had normal levels of this steroid. These results indicate that CS can inhibit male aggressive behavior and testicular function in a lizard and support the hypothesis that the behavior changes observed in subordinate animals following defeat in agonistic encounters may in part be due to increased plasma CS levels.},

	Abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions play important roles in the development of the vertebrate integument with its diverse appendages. As a result of these interactions, specific morphogenetic events occur which result in the formation of distinct epidermal appendages. Following the early morphogenetic events involving cell proliferation and movement, other developmental events such as stratification, histotypic differentiation, and terminal cytodifferentiation occur in the epidermis. Using the common lizard Anolis carolinensis, we are seeking to obtain a better understanding of the relationship between the various developmental events and the expression of alpha and beta keratins, with the aim of eventually understanding the mechanisms by which tissue-specific keratinization patterns are established in the integument. As a first step, we have used immunoblot analyses and indirect immunofluorescence procedures with antisera specific for either alpha or beta keratins to determine the temporal and spatial appearance of these keratins at specific developmental stages. We have found that: 1) There are relatively low molecular weight alpha keratin polypeptides present in the epidermis early in development as morphogenesis is taking place. 2) After morphogenesis occurs and histogenesis is well under way, the alpha keratins which characterize the adult epidermis appear. 3) Only alpha keratins are found in the basal cells of all regions of the epidermis. 4) beta keratins are found only in the suprabasal layers of well-developed scales and show region-specific distribution in overlapping scales.},

	Abstract = {Skin of the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, is remarkably sensitive to light. Illuminated in vitro with visible light from a tungsten source (110 W (m-2)), skin changes from brilliant green to dark brown (50% reduction in reflectance) within 2-4 min as a result of dispersion of melanin from a perinuclear position within dermal melanophores into superficial dendritic processes. Reversal of the process, reaggregation of pigment, will occur within 2.0 min upon return to darkness. This photic response can be initiated with light levels as low as 5.0 W m(-2) and is maximized by light levels only 5% that of midwinter sunshine. Pigment dispersion in response to both melanocyte simulating hormone and to light is inhibited by cytochalasin-B, indicating that microfilaments may be the motor element for pigment movement in that direction. Colchicine, but not cytochalasin-B, totally blocks pigment reaggregation following melanocyte stimulating hormone exposure and partially blocks it in the dark phase of the photic response. The results of this study are consistent with a model for pigment movement in A. carolinensis that provides microfilaments for pigment dispersion and microtubule involvement in both dispersion and aggregation. Finally, because it is readily visible, easily quantified, rapid and reversible, photic response in the skin of A. carolinensis is recommended as a valuable model system for the study of saltatory movement of organelles within cells.},

	Abstract = {We have compared the structure-function relationship of the tridecapeptide alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) on the melanophores of the lizard Anolis carolinensis and the frog Rana pipiens by determining the melanosome-dispersing potency of 15 shorter peptide sequences and 8 substituted alpha-MSH analogues. Major differences were found between the lizard and the frog in their response to alpha-MSH peptide fragments and analogues. In Anolis, the sequence Ser-Tyr-Ser- is not as important for the pigmentary response as in Rana since alpha-MSH-(4-13) was nearly as potent (89%) as alpha-MSH-(1-13) (100%), whereas in Rana alpha-MSH-(4-13) potency was reduced to 7.5%. In addition, loss of potency due to removal of residues Pro and Val was more marked in Rana (alpha-MSH-(1-11) = 0.1%) than in Anolis (alpha-MSH-(1-11) = 1%), suggesting that this C-terminal sequence is necessary for pigmentary activity in the frog melanophore. These results together with those of other peptide fragments and analogues have led us to define the minimal pigmentary sequence of alpha-MSH as alpha-MSH-(4-12) in Anolis in contrast to alpha-MSH-(1-13) in Rana. This suggests that Anolis and Rana alpha-MSH receptors recognise different message amino acids of the alpha-MSH peptide sequence even though the final response (melanosome dispersion) is the same.},

	Abstract = {We determined the effects of acute stretch on spontaneous and arginine vasotocin (AVT)-driven contractions of the Anolis carolinensis uterus in vitro. Whole uteri from reproductively inactive females (October) were placed in a bath of oxygenated 32 degrees C Anolis "Ringer's." Two initial tensions were utilized, 1.5 g or 15 g, the latter being an estimate of the tension on the wall of a uterine compartment. Uteri were then exposed to either saline or AVT (50 ng/ml), and spontaneous or AVT-driven contractions were recorded for 20 min with the use of a strain gauge and physiograph. A similar experiment was performed on uteri from reproductively active females in the summer (June). Our results indicate that the effects of acute stretch and AVT on uterine contractility were qualitatively similar in summer and fall. That is, AVT induced a tonic contraction; stretch decreased the duration of the tonic contraction; the saline-treated uteri exhibited spontaneous rhythmic contractions; AVT increased the amplitude of the rhythmic contractions, but only at the lower tension; there were no effects of AVT on the timing (contraction interval, duration, rest interval) of the rhythmic contractions; and stretch increased the frequency of the rhythmic contractions. Season greatly influenced the magnitude of these contractile phenomena. Uteri tested during the breeding season exhibited greater distensibility, an increase in the amplitude and duration of the AVT-driven tonic contraction, and an increase in the frequency of both spontaneous and AVT-driven rhythmic contractions because of a decrease in both contraction duration and rest interval.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

In the frog (Rana pipiens) and lizard (Anolis carolinensis) skin bioassays, the 5-17 and 5-14 fragments of MCH were inactive (at concentrations of 10(-5)M or less), whereas the 1-14 sequence exhibited minimal (about 10%) MSH-like activity compared to MCH, which, as reported previously, was about 600 times less active than alpha-MSH. In the teleost (fish) skin bioassay, the MCH5-17 analogue was equipotent to MCH, whereas the 1-14 analogue was 10-30 times and the cyclic N- and C- terminal truncated analogue, MCH5-14, was about 300 times less active than MCH. These results suggest that the N-terminal sequence is particularly critical to MSH-like activity in the tetrapod species studied, whereas other structural regions of MCH, particularly in the C-terminal, are more related to MCH activity in teleosts.},

Three weeks after implantation, males were tested with stimulus males and two days later with stimulus females. Cyproterone acetate inhibited aspects of male aggressive and sexual behavior, and reduced testis weight and size of the renal sex segment. Plasma testosterone (T) levels in CA-treated males were not significantly different than those of P-treated males. Flutamide did not inhibit aggressive or sexual behavior, but did decrease testis weight as well as the size of the renal sex segment. Plasma T levels were significantly higher in F-treated males than in P-treated males.

	Abstract = {The role of protein kinase C in melanosome dispersion was examined using the melanophores of the lizard Anolis carolinensis and an in-vitro rate method of bioassay. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which directly activates protein kinase C, was able to potentiate the melanophore response to alpha-MSH in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the stimulatory response to forskolin, which activates the adenylate cyclase catalytic subunit, was also potentiated by TPA. The response of the melanophore to cyclic AMP, however, remained unaltered by any dose of TPA. We thus propose that the potentiation of alpha-MSH potency by TPA is through an interaction of protein kinase C with adenylate cyclase and, more specifically, that this interaction may be at the level of the linkage of the nucleotide regulatory subunit Ns with the catalytic moiety C of adenylate cyclase.},

	Abstract = {Lacking sympathetic innervation, the skin of A. carolinensis, an iguanid lizard, darkens within minutes in response to circulating melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) or beta adrenergic agonists such as epinephrine (EPI). This change is produced by dispersion of melanin from a perinculear position within dermal melanophores into superficial dendritic processes. These melanophores possess alpha-2 and beta-2 adrenergic as well as MSH receptors except in a patch of skin behind the eye, the eyespot, which lacks alpha receptors. Activation of beta or MSH receptors leads to stimulation of adenyl cyclase whereas alpha stimulation inhibits the enzyme to override the others. In a series of trials, injection of saline or propranolol was followed after 30 minutes by saline, EPI, or MSH. Propranolol inhibited chromatophore response to EPI. It also, unexpectedly, retarded the response to MSH, increasing latency to eyespot formation and body color change as well as the duration of darkening for both. Alteration of MSH response by a beta blocker could be explained by linkage of both adrenergic receptors and the MSH receptor to a common adenyl cyclase molecule to form a functional unit in the membrane of the melanophore.},

In Anolis pulchellus the egg content which is very yolky is homogeneously distributed throughout the egg with no apparent presence of an egg-white. Nevertheless, after resuspension in 0.02 M glycine (pH 7.2), a yolk pellet and a fraction with soluble proteins were separated by low-speed centrifugation. By chromatography in Sephadex G-100, the major egg yolk protein (S-1) was highly purified. This protein was characterized as a glyco-lipo-phosphoprotein with a mol wt of 110,000-120,000 as shown by SDS PAGE. By DEAE cellulose chromatography two acidic proteins (D-5; D-6) were purified (Mr = 62,000-66,000), which do not seem to be components of the yolk granules. Protein D-5 was shown to be a Fe2+-binding protein. By immunochemistry, the liver was found to be the site of synthesis of S-1 and D-5; both proteins are female specific. It is also demonstrated that S-1 shares several chemical and structural properties with the lipovitellins from other oviparous animals.},

	Abstract = {The pineal organ of the lizard Anolis carolinensis acts as a transducer of photoperiodic information, since light can affect the pineal melatonin rhythm (PMR). The synthesis and secretion of melatonin may be a major mechanism whereby a circadian pacemaker within the pineal can control circadian clocks located elsewhere. An investigation into potential routes by which light could affect the PMR showed that (1) removal of the photosensory parietal eye did not affect the PMR as compared to controls under either a light-dark (LD) 12:12 cycle and a constant temperature (32 degrees C) or an LD 12:12 cycle and a daily temperature cycle (32 degrees C/20 degrees C); (2) removal of both the parietal eye and the lateral eyes did not affect the PRM of anoles held in LD 12:12 (constant 32 degrees C); (3) the PMR of blinded anoles re-entrained to a 10-hr shift in the phase of the LD cycle as rapidly as that of sighted anoles; (4) blocking light penetration to the brains of anoles, but leaving the lateral eyes exposed, blocked the ability of anoles to re-entrain to a 10-hr shift in the phase of an LD cycle. The data support the hypothesis that light directly affects the PMR in Anolis and that other potential photic inputs (parietal eye, lateral eyes) play little or no role. This conclusion is supported by previous neurophysiological and ultrastructural studies showing that the lizard pineal possesses functional photoreceptors.},

	Abstract = {Both light and temperature can influence the pineal's synthesis of the indoleamine melatonin. An investigation of the effects of light and temperature cycles on the pineal melatonin rhythm (PMR) showed the following: (1) Both daily light cycles and daily temperature cycles could entrain the PMR; melatonin levels peaked during the dark phase of a light-dark cycle or the cool phase of a temperature cycle. (2) The PMR could be entrained by a temperature cycle as low as 2 degrees C in amplitude in lizards held in constant light or constant darkness. (3) The length of the photoperiod or thermoperiod affected the phase, amplitude, or duration of the PMR. (4) When presented together, the effects of light and temperature cycles on the PMR depended on the phase relationship between the light and temperature cycles, as well as on the strength of the entraining stimuli, such as the amplitude of the temperature cycle. (5) Exposure to a constant cold temperature (10 degrees C) eliminated the PMR, yet a rhythm could still be expressed under a 24-hr temperature cycle (32 degrees C/10 degrees C), and the rhythm peaked during the 10 degrees C phase of the cycle. (6) A 6-hr dark pulse presented during the day did not elicit a premature rise in melatonin levels. These studies show how environmental stimuli can control the pineal rhythm of melatonin synthesis and secretion. Previous studies have supported a model in which the lizard's pineal acts as a circadian pacemaker within a multioscillator circadian system, and have implicated melatonin as a hormone by which the pineal may communicate with the rest of the system. The lizard pineal, therefore, may act as a photo- and thermoendocrine transducer translating light and temperature information into an internal cue in the form of the PMR. The PMR, in turn, may control the phase and period of circadian clocks located elsewhere, insuring that the right internal events occur at the right time of day.},

	Abstract = {Sperm surface changes occurring in the reptile Wolffian duct have been explored with particular references to the snake, Natrix fasciata. In the snake Wolffian duct there are several proteins not present in serum, the pattern of which changes in concert with the seasonal testicular cycle. Whereas testicular spermatozoa did not bind antibody to duct secretions, all Wolffian duct spermatozoa did so over both head and tail, according to immunofluorescence patterns. Thus, on entering the Wolffian duct, the entire surface of N. fasciata spermatozoa acquires one of more of the duct's secretory components. As indicated by immunofluorescence, immunoelectrophoresis, and immunodiffusion, epitopes on at least some molecules that bind to spermatozoa or that remain free in the duct fluid are shared with those in other Natrix species, but not in more distant reptiles (turtle, anole lizard), nor chicken, rat, or rabbit. In regard to glycoproteins, one prominent con A-reactive band was present in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of snake fluid and more were evident in fluid collected from the turtle duct. However, such lectin-reactive elements did not bind to spermatozoa as judged by an absence of any change in snake, turtle and lizard sperm lectin-binding patterns in passing from the testis into and through the Wolffian duct. In all, evidence from these and other species studied begins to suggest that the nature of the post-testicular sperm surface modification displayed in most vertebrates that fertilize internally may differ in sub-therian and therian groups, respectively. There appears to be a relative emphasis on glycosyl-rich surface elements in the latter. The possible significance of these changes for sperm function in the different groups is discussed briefly in terms of sperm survival/storage, as well as capacitation and sperm binding to the zona.},

The hypothesis that a similar relationship exists in reptiles was tested by placing twelve lizards in volumetrically constant but large-scale or small-scale "home" environments and alternately exposing them to large and small scale novel environments in a counterbalanced design. Behavioral measures included latencies and frequencies for four types of behavior associated with behavioral arousal and exploration and for duration of behavioral states. Results indicate (1) behavioral latencies are significantly reduced in small-scale novel environments and (2) as predicted, the ratio of latencies in large-scale divided by small-scale novel environments is essentially identical to the ratio of the scales of the environments themselves. Linear regression analyses relating latencies to the ratio yield results remarkably similar to those previously reported for temporal experience and spatial scale in human subjects. This research suggests that an experiential temporal-spatial relativity may be phylogenetically primitive.},

@article{Rabinowitz:1986aa,
	Abstract = {Based on regional differences in surface morphology, the dorsum of the tongue of Anolis carolinensis can be subdivided into four distinct zones. The first quarter of the tongue is relatively smooth, whereas the second and fourth quarters are festooned with closely packed cylindriform papillae, which are covered by typical parakeratotic stratified squamous epithelium. The third quarter of the tongue is covered by papillae of novel morphology that we have named "plumose papillae." These are composed of a slender connective tissue core covered by stratified squamous epithelium from whose surface numerous elongated cells radiate. These "plume cells" are about 30-40 microns long and have an extremely irregular nucleus in their expanded terminus. Their stalks are affixed by desmosomes to the deeper cells of the epithelium, and their free surfaces are covered by intricately patterned microplications. Their cytosol contains a dense web of 100-A cytofilaments that may be involved in maintaining the peculiar morphology of the cells. Regardless of type, all lingual papillae of A. carolinensis contain a single longitudinally oriented skeletal muscle fiber that originates from the underlying lingual muscles, raising the possibility that the papillae can be moved at will. The plumose papillae and their retinue of plume cells are unique morphological structures that may be important in mastication and deglutition of food.},

@article{Fleishman:1986aa,
	Abstract = {Anolis lizards respond to a moving object viewed in the periphery of their visual field by turning their eye to fixate the object with their central fovea. This paper describes the relative effectiveness of different patterns of motion of a small black lure in eliciting these eye movements and the way motion of a backdrop of vegetation affects the response. The stimulus was positioned 45 degrees from the animal's line of gaze and oscillated in the vertical axis at different frequencies between 0.5 and 10 Hz. At each frequency, the amplitude of the oscillation was increased until the lizard flicked its eye towards the stimulus. The minimum amplitude needed for response (0.22 degrees of visual angle) was independent of frequency and waveform. The probability of any response occurring was, however, lower at higher frequencies (7 and 10 Hz) and a 1.5 Hz square wave evoked the greatest proportion of responses. Sinusoidal oscillation of a background of vegetation at 1.6 Hz during or before motion of the stimulus lure reduced the probability of an eye flick but did not raise the minimum amplitude needed for a response. The suppressive effect was greatest when the lure was oscillated at frequencies close to that of the background. It is concluded that Anolis, which rely upon motion to detect objects in the periphery of the visual field, filter out irrelevant motion such as that of windblown vegetation by responding preferentially to particular patterns of motion and short term habituation to commonly present patterns of motion.},

	Abstract = {Proteins from the all-cone retina of the lizard Anolis carolinensis were phosphorylated using [gamma 32P] ATP, separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Several proteins incorporated 32P. Exposure of the retinal homogenates to light brought about a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of the protein(s) with a molecular weight nearly identical to that of rat rhodopsin. It is likely that these proteins are the cone visual pigments, and that they incorporate phosphate when bleached by light. Increasing the time of the phosphorylation reaction from 1 to 30 min led to an increase in the amount of incorporation of labeled phosphate by the putative cone visual pigments, but changing the temperature from 4 degrees C to 20 degrees C decreased it. The amount of phosphate incorporation was substantially increased by NaF, a phosphatase inhibitor. This latter finding, along with the changes in incorporation of 32P with increased temperature, suggest that a phosphoprotein phosphatase is active in the lizard retina. The cation requirements, as well as the effects of cyclic nucleotides on light-induced phosphorylation of retinal lizard proteins, were also investigated.},

	Abstract = {Highly purified ACTH and MSH peptides were studied in isolated rat glomerulosa and inner zone cells and their activity compared with that in an Anolis melanophore assay. While both ACTH1-39 and ACTH1-24 were almost equally potent steroidogenic peptides in the two cell types (ED50 between 1 and 4 X 10(-12) M), alpha-MSH displayed only weak steroidogenic activity. Although it was a full agonist, it was about 10(4)-fold less potent in both capsular and inner zone cells. beta-MSH (porcine) was even 10-fold less active in capsular cells than alpha-MSH, and in inner zone cells it was a partial agonist. Highly potent melanotropic peptides, such as (Nle4, D-Phe7)-alpha-MSH or cyclic (Cys4, Cys10)-alpha-MSH were either inactive or exhibited only a very slight partial steroidogenic activity in both cell types. Comparison of the activity profile of additional compounds, such as des-acetyl alpha-MSH, (Tyr(I)2)-alpha-MSH, (Trp(For)9)-alpha-MSH or (Nva12)-alpha-MSH, in the adrenocortical and pigment cell assays led to the conclusion that alpha-MSH does not exert its steroidogenic effect through a typical melanocyte-type of MSH receptor, but rather through a low affinity-type of ACTH receptor.},

	Abstract = {This study examined the hypothesis that aromatization of testosterone (T) to estradiol (E) is required to activate reproductive behavior in castrated male lizards (Anolis sagrei). Adult, reproductively active males were assigned to an intact control group or to one of four treatment groups. Treatment males were castrated and 1 week later three of the four castrated groups were implanted with subcutaneous pellets containing either 0.05 mg of E, 0.5 mg of T, or 0.5 mg of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Two weeks after pellet implantation, males were tested with stimulus males, and 2 days later were tested with stimulus females. Behavioral tests were of 15-min duration and were videotaped. Significantly fewer E-treated castrates erected a crest in tests with stimulus males than did intact males. In tests with stimulus females, significantly fewer E-treated castrates displayed, neck-gripped, and intromitted than did intact males. Estradiol-treated castrates also showed significantly less display behavior than did intact males. However, aggressive and sexual behavior of DHT-treated castrates was not significantly different from that of intact males. The same was true for T-treated castrates with the exception that display behavior in tests with stimulus females was reduced compared to that of intact males. The results suggest that aromatization of T to E is not required for induction of androgen-dependent reproductive behavior in this lizard.},

	Abstract = {Several alpha-melanotropin (alpha-MSH) analogues with para substituted aromatic and nonaromatic amino acids in the 7-position of the hormone were prepared and their melanotropic activities determined in the frog (Rana pipiens) and lizard (Anolis carolinensis) skin bioassays. D and L-Phe(p-NO2), D- and L-Tyr, D- and L-Ala, and Gly were substituted in the 7-position. The use of substituted D or L-aromatic amino acids in the 7th position of the central Ac-[Nle4]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 fragment resulted in a loss in potency relative to the corresponding phenylalanine-containing analogue. The loss in potency cannot be due entirely to steric hindrance at the melanophore receptor, since nonaromatic amino acids substituted in the 7th position of this octapeptide fragment also generally led to a loss in biological activity. We reported previously that replacement of phenylalanine-7 by its D enantiomer led to a marked increase in potency in each fragment analogue tested. Analogues containing other D amino acids in the 7th position also were more potent than their L amino acid-containing analogues with one exception: Ac-[Nle4, Ala7]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 was more potent than Ac-[Nle4, D-Ala7]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 in the frog skin bioassay. Replacement of phenylalanine-7 by glycine resulted in a large decrease in potency in both bioassays, illustrating the importance of the side chain group, in this position of alpha-MSH, to biological potency of the hormone.},

	Abstract = {Recent work in our laboratory indicated that the liver of rats and pigeons secretes a prolactin synergist (synlactin) in vitro. We have investigated the secretion of this activity by the liver of nine species of ectothermic vertebrates. Liver from three teleosts (goby, salmon, and tilapia), four amphibians (Ambystoma, Necturus, bullfrog, and grass frog) and two reptiles (turtle and anole) was diced, washed, and incubated for 3 hr in isotonic medium. After dialysis, the liver incubation media (LIM) were tested with and without prolactin (PRL) in the local pigeon crop-sac bioassay. The LIM for turtle, larval bullfrog, freshwater salmon, and 5% seawater-adapted goby significantly augmented the local crop-sac response to PRL, but the LIM from anole, adult bullfrog, grass frog, fasted larval Ambystoma, Necturus, 100% seawater-adapted goby, and tilapia did not contain synergizing activity. We conclude that synlactin is secreted by the liver of several species representing three of the major ectothermic classes of vertebrates. It is significant that in two cases, larval bullfrog and 5% seawater-adapted goby, the presence of synlactin occurs in physiological states in which PRL is active. In the opposite cases (adult frog and 100% seawater-adapted goby) the activity was not detectable. We also found that the liver of larval and adult bullfrogs and tilapia released a factor in vitro that had proliferative activity in the crop-sac. This activity appears to be distinct from synlactin.},

	Abstract = {Specific insulin receptors are present in the liver and brain of the lizard Anolis carolinesis. In this study, the specific binding of 125I-insulin to the receptors showed time, temperature and pH dependency. Specific binding to crude membranes prepared from brain was 1-2% of the total radioactivity added compared to 4-5% in the crude membranes prepared from liver. Solubilization and wheat germ agglutinin purification of the membranes resulted in an increase in the specific binding (per mg of protein) between 6 and 32 times for liver membranes and 13-186 for brain membranes. Binding inhibition of tracer insulin by unlabeled porcine insulin was characteristic for insulin receptors with 50% inhibition for liver crude membranes at 60 ng/ml of porcine insulin and 0.7 ng/ml for purified brain insulin receptors. Chicken insulin was 2- to 3-fold more potent and proinsulin about 100 times less potent than porcine insulin. The alpha-subunits of liver and brain had apparent molecular weights on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 135 kDa and 120 kDa respectively. Apparent molecular weights of beta subunits were 92 kDa for both tissues. Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of the beta subunit of both brain and liver receptors. Both tissues demonstrated tyrosine-specific phosphorylation, which was stimulated by insulin, of exogenously added artificial substrates. In addition, purified brain insulin receptor preparations contained an endogenous protein with apparent molecular weight of 105 kDa, whose phosphorylation was stimulated by insulin (10(-7) mol/l). This phosphoprotein was not immunoprecipitated by anti-insulin receptor antibodies. These studies suggest that the structural differences between brain and liver receptors previously demonstrated in the rat are also present in the lizard, which is about 300,000,000 years older than the mammalian species. Thus, there is strong evolutionary conservation of the brain insulin receptor.},

	Abstract = {The biological activity and a possible modulatory role of the N-terminal tetrapeptide Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met from alpha-MSH/ACTH was tested in the Anolis melanophore assay, the Xenopus melanophore assay, tyrosinase stimulation in mouse melanoma cells and in excessive grooming in the rat. ACTH1-4 did not exhibit biological activity in any of these four assays nor did it have modulatory properties in the Xenopus and the melanoma cell assay. However, in the Anolis assay ACTH1-4 potentiated pigment dispersion induced by alpha-MSH, alpha-MSH5-13 and ACTH1-24 by a factor of about 2. In the grooming assay ACTH1-4 potentiated the effects of alpha-MSH, alpha-MSH5-13, ACTH1-16 and ACTH5-16, but not those of ACTH1-24. Oxidized ACTH1-4 was without biological activity and potentiating properties in all four assays. This study shows that small fragments of the pro-opiomelanocortin precursor, which are devoid of biological activity, can modulate peripheral and central actions of alpha-MSH/ACTH.},

	Abstract = {Myelin of several Caudata (Urodela) species appears to be unique in the fact that it lacks hydroxycerebrosides and hydroxysulfatides although it contains their non-hydroxy counterparts. Comparison of the nerve conduction velocities in the Urodeles Necturus (salamander) and Notophthalmus (newt) with that in a reptile, Anolis (chameleon) which contains hydroxycerebrosides and -sulfatides indicated that the values were significantly reduced in the urodeles. Furthermore, urodele myelin thickness remained uniformly the same regardless of the size of the nerve fiber. Despite these differences the myelins appeared structurally similar. Electron microscopic and X-ray diffraction studies did not disclose any structural difference between the two orders. A teased fiber technique established that the ratio of internodal distance and fiber diameter in urodele nerves was essentially similar to that in Anolis. These findings suggest that the absence of hydroxycerebroside and -sulfatide may be related to the reduction in nerve conduction velocity and unusual myelin thickness in the urodele nervous system.},

	Abstract = {The isoelectric focusing (IEF) profiles of pituitary gonadotropic (GTH) activity in six species of adult male amphibians were examined in addition to the newt and bullfrog. The GTH activity was measured by two radioreceptor assay (RRA) systems; one with Xenopus laevis testicular homogenate as the receptor preparation, and the other with Anolis carolinensis testicular homogenate, both employing 125I-labeled rat FSH as the radioligand, or by a radioimmunoassay (RIA) system for bullfrog basic GTH (LH). The IEF profiles were classified into four groups: (1) Cynops pyrrhogaster pyrrhogaster, Onychodactylus japonicus, (2) X. laevis, (3) Rana japonica, Bufo japonicus formosus, (4) Rana nigromaculata, Hyla arborea japonica, Rana catesbeiana. In Onychodactylus japonicus (Group 1), Anolis RRA-positive peaks and Xenopus RRA-positive peaks were found in almost the same fractions. They were in the alkaline to neutral pH region. This IEF profile was very similar to that of newt pituitary GTH in July when spermatogenesis was active. In X. laevis (Group 2), the IEF profile was similar to that of urodeles. However, the most alkaline peak was found at pH 9.02, which was lower than those of urodeles. These peaks showed some differences in the reactivity to the RRA systems. In R. japonica (Group 3), the major peak obtained by Xenopus RRA was found at pH 10.27, which corresponded to the only positive peak obtained by the RIA system for bullfrog basic GTH. Furthermore, this peak was also recognized by Anolis RRA as one of the eight peaks, which appeared in the alkaline to acidic region. In B. japonicus formosus (Group 3), similar results were observed. In H. arborea japonica, R. nigromaculata and R. catesbeiana (Group 4), Anolis RRA-positive and Xenopus RRA-positive peaks were quite independent, indicating distinct separation of LH and FSH, though pIs of FSH-like GTH in the frogs were not so acidic as those of mammalian and avian FSH.},

At a constant temperature, the duration of the photoperiod has a profound effect on the duration, amplitude, and phase of the pineal melatonin rhythm (Fig. 1). The pineal melatonin rhythm under cyclic temperature peaks during the cool (20 degrees C) phase of the cycle regardless of whether or not the cool phase occurs during the light or dark phase of a LD 12:12 cycle (Fig. 3). Under a temperature cycle and constant dim illumination, a pineal melatonin rhythm is observed which peaks during the cool phase of the temperature cycle, but the amplitude of the rhythm is depressed relative to that observed under LD (Fig. 2). Illumination up to 2 h in duration does not suppress the nocturnal melatonin peak in the Anolis pineal (Fig. 4). No melatonin rhythm was observed in the eyes of Anolis under either 24 h LD cycles and a constant temperature (Fig. 1), or under simultaneous light and temperature cycles (Fig. 3).

Furthermore, female A. carolinensis appear to be more sensitive to hormone treatment during different times of the year.

	Abstract = {The discovery that the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) previously prepared from the green sea turtle, Chelonia mydas, contained a major neurohypophysial contaminant prompted a repurification and characterization of the glycoprotein hormones in this turtle. Results reaffirmed the physicochemical distinctiveness of the three hormones. Minimal cross-contamination between hormones (less than 2%) was achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, subunit dissociation (of contaminating luteinizing hormone (LH], gel filtration, and immuno-affinity chromatography. New preparations of FSH and thyrotrophin (TSH) derived from adult pituitaries proved to be more potent than those described previously (the degree depending on the nature of the assay); FSH showed the expected increase in activity based on estimated contamination of previous preparations. LH was similar to original preparations except for enhanced activity in FSH radioreceptor assays. Binding assays (in heterologous and homologous systems) again demonstrated the general absence of an FSH-specific receptor in the reptilian (chelonian and squamate) testes. In an in vivo bioassay in the lizard Anolis, the turtle FSH was orders of magnitude more potent than LH in stimulating both testis growth and androgen secretion, but in vitro LH was considerably more potent than FSH in stimulating androgen secretion in squamate and chelonian testes. Thus, the possibility exists that androgen secretion in some chelonian systems may exhibit a high degree of LH specificity like that of mammals and birds.},

	Abstract = {The freeze-fracture technique was used to study differences in membrane structure which could explain differences in the number of quanta released from axon terminals on twitch and tonic muscle fibers in Anolis intercostal muscles. The protoplasmic leaflets of axon terminals facing lizard twitch muscle fibers have intramembrane particle specializations characterized by two parallel linear particle arrays each composed of two particle rows which lie perpendicular to the axis of shallow ridges in the axolemma. During K+ depolarization, vesicles open between the arrays, confirming that these structures are the active zones for synaptic vesicle opening. Active zones at axon terminals on tonic fibers are defined by one linear particle array composed of two parallel particle rows oriented along the axis of a shallow presynaptic ridge; vesicles open beside these arrays. Thus, there are more particles near active zone vesicles in terminals on twitch fibers. Even though terminals on twitch and tonic muscle fibers seem to have similar numbers of synaptic vesicles associated with their active zones, a presynaptic action potential is reported to release at least 10 times more quanta from terminals on twitch fibers. We postulate that the differences in quantal output are related to the observed differences in the number of active zone particles flanking synaptic vesicles at the active zone. Indeed, the correlation between the distribution of these particles and the level of transmitter release provides additional support for the idea that they are the calcium channels which couple transmitter release to the action potential.},

	Abstract = {The melanosome dispersing activity of prostaglandins PGE1, PGE2, PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha, PGI2 and 6 beta PGI, was tested on the melanophores of Anolis carolinensis. Only PGE2 and PGE1 were active and while PGE2 was the most potent and acted synergistically with alpha-MSH, PGE1 was additive with alpha-MSH. Arachidonic acid also stimulated melanosome dispersion but its effect was blocked by indomethacin suggesting an action through its conversion to PGE1 or PGE2. The effect of alpha-MSH, on the other hand, was unaltered by indomethacin which suggests that alpha-MSH stimulated melanosome dispersion does not depend upon prostaglandin synthesis. Thus, while some prostaglandins may interact with alpha-MSH to stimulate melanosome dispersion they are unlikely to mediate its action.},

	Abstract = {The effects of pinealectomy and exogenous melatonin treatment on the reproductive system of male anoles were examined at several different times of year. In September pinealectomy of anoles exposed to either a stimulatory LD 14:10 light cycle or a nonstimulatory LD 10:14 light cycle induced significant testicular growth and development over that observed in sham-operated anoles. At a nonphotosensitive time of year (December) pinealectomy also had a significant progonadal effect but no effect of pinealectomy was seen in February-March. Daily melatonin injections given either in the morning or afternoon (or both) failed to block gonadal growth either (1) in sham-operated or pinealectomized anoles exposed to LD 14:10 in the fall or (2) in pinealectomized lizards exposed to LD 10:14 in the fall. Continuous melatonin administration via subcutaneous silastic implants blocked the progonadal effects of pinealectomy in the winter (December). The results show that pinealectomy can have significant progonadal effects; these effects are seasonal but can encompass phases of the annual testicular cycle which are either photoperiod-dependent or temperature-dependent; and melatonin may be a reproductively active factor involved.},

	Abstract = {Gravid proglottids of Oochoristica anolis from naturally infected anole lizards, Anolis carolinensis, were placed in covered Petri dishes with laboratory-reared beetles, Tribolium confusum and Tenebrio molitor. After maintenance at 25 C, metacestodes developed in 29 of 61 T. confusum (48%), but in none of 5 T. molitor. Beetles contained from 1 to 22 metacestodes (means = 3.3), which were fully developed by day 40 postexposure. A primary lacuna was never observed, but the possibility of its presence could not be ruled out without histological study. No cercomer was formed and metacestodes retained larval hooks throughout development. Scolices were invaginated at removal from the hemocoel, but usually evaginated quickly in Ringer's. On day 60 postexposure, metacestodes were fed by stomach tube to 5 anoles, 2 lacertid lizards (Podarcis muralis) and 2 mice. Worms developed only in anoles, 3 of which were infected upon examination. Oncospheral hooks were present in worms after 7 days development in the lizard; a median excretory pore was present at the posterior tip of all stages examined, including the terminal mature proglottid of a worm after 105 days in a lizard. Scolex growth rate was linear throughout metacestode and adult development, but growth rate in body length was diphasic, punctuated by change of hosts, associated with strobilization. Attempts to establish parenteral infections in anoles were unsuccessful. Present data constitute the most complete life history study thus far for any species of Oochoristica.},

	Abstract = {Photoaffinity labelling of MSH receptors on Anolis melanophores was used as a tool for studying the effects of catecholamines, calcium and forskolin on hormone-receptor interaction and receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling. Covalent attachment of photoreactive alpha-MSH to its receptor was suppressed in calcium-free buffer but was hardly influenced by catecholamines or forskolin. The longlasting signal generated by the covalent MSH-receptor complex was readily and reversibly abolished by adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine or clonidine or by the absence of calcium. The suppression of pigment dispersion by catecholamines was blocked by the simultaneous presence of yohimbine but not prazosin, indicating that the catecholamines antagonize the alpha-MSH signal by inhibitory action on the adenylate cyclase system through an alpha-2 receptor. Forskolin, which stimulates melanophores by direct action on the catalytic unit of the adenylate cyclase and at about the same speed as alpha-MSH, produced a slower and weaker response in the presence of noradrenaline. If MSH receptors were covalently labelled and then exposed to noradrenaline, the characteristics of the forskolin-induced response were identical to those of unlabelled cells that had not been exposed to noradrenaline. This may point to a partial restoration of receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling by forskolin. The results show that the longlasting stimulation of Anolis melanophores by photoaffinity labelling proceeds via a permanently stimulated adenylate-cyclase system whose coupling to the receptor depends on calcium and is abolished by alpha-2 receptor agonists. Calcium is also essential for hormone-receptor binding.},

	Abstract = {The immunocytochemical distribution of beta-endorphin and other proopiomelanocortin (POMC) peptides in the central nervous system of the lizard Anolis carolinensis was determined. Colchicine pretreatment was used to enhance perikaryal immunoreactivity. A major finding of this study is the localization of a previously undetected mesencephalic cell group which exhibits immunoreactivity to beta-endorphin, ACTH, and alpha-MSH. The perikarya of these neurons are large, bipolar, and situated in the mesencephalic tegmental area. They appear to project to the mesencephalic central gray and other brainstem structures. In contrast, the immunoreactive parvicellular perikarya of the medial-basal hypothalamus, corresponding to the POMC perikarya of the rodent arcuate nucleus, exhibit major rostral projections to various telencephalic and diencephalic structures. The exact extent of fiber projections and innervation patterns arising from either of these two groups is not clear at this time and will require further analyses. Scattered fiber immunoreactivity was also seen in the medial cerebral cortex and the striatal complex, regions which apparently are not innervated by beta-endorphin fibers in the rodent brain. Also, no immunoreactivity was seen to an antiserum to the 16K peptide of POMC. Other similarities and differences in the brain distribution of POMC in reptiles and mammals are discussed.},

Reproductively active females were injected with 1.0 micrograms PGF, 0.1 micrograms PGF, or 0.05 ml saline. Animals were killed 2, 6, or 24 hr after injection. Prostaglandin treatment induced luteolysis as evidenced by significant decreases in plasma progesterone concentration in animals sacrificed 6 and 24 hr after treatment. Both doses of PGF were effective. However, 0.1 micrograms PGF induced luteolysis in less than 50% of the treatment group. Luteal degradation became apparent at the cellular level 24 hr after PGF treatment whereas no significant changes were observed in corpora lutea of the 2- or 6-hr postinjection specimens. These data suggest that PGF is a luteolytic agent in reptiles.},

Three initial tensions were utilized, 0.15, 1.5, and 10.0 g; the latter, after relaxation, produced follicles with a tension similar to that on the wall of an intact vitellogenic follicle. Follicles at each tension then were exposed to either saline or 50 ng/ml arginine vasotocin (AVT). Spontaneous, rhythmic follicular contractions occurred (approx one every 3 min), regardless of initial tension. The higher the initial tension, however, the greater the amplitude of the contractions. Treatment with AVT did not influence any parameter of rhythmic contraction. This report of rhythmic contractions of whole follicular walls of Anolis suggests that contractile activity of myofibroblasts in the wall plays a role in follicular growth and/or ovulation.},

	Abstract = {In order to investigate the biosynthesis of ACTH- and beta-endorphin-related substances in the pars distalis of Anolis carolinensis, explants of pars distali were incubated for 24 hr in a complete medium which contained [3H]tyrosine. Acid extracts of the incubates were immunoprecipitated with either an affinity-purified ACTH antiserum or an affinity-purified beta-endorphin antiserum and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Three distinct peaks of ACTH-related material were detected. The major peak comigrated with human ACTH(1-39), while two minor peaks corresponded in apparent molecular weight to ACTH biosynthetic intermediate and precursor-sized material. Three peaks of beta-endorphin-related material were also detected. The major peak comigrated with beta-endorphin(1-31), while two minor peaks corresponded to beta-lipotropin (LPH) and precursor-sized material. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the precursor-sized material had antigenic determinants for both ACTH and beta-endorphin. In addition this peak was identical in apparent molecular weight to the common precursor for alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and beta-endorphin in the pars intermedia of A. carolinensis (R.M. Dores, Peptides 3, 925-935). Analysis of extracts of reptile pars distalis by gel-filtration chromatography revealed a single peak of naloxone-reversible opiate bioactivity which coeluted with the peak of beta-endorphin-sized immunoreactivity. On a molar basis there is tenfold more opiate bioactivity in the reptile pars distalis than in the reptile pars intermedia.},

	Abstract = {The tight junctions between endothelial cells of capillaries in the forebrain of Anolis carolinensis are a common component of the structural basis for the blood-brain barrier in this reptile. The complexity of these junctions, which is apparent in platinum replicas of freeze-fractured brain capillaries, is unchanged by treatments designed to render the blood-brain barrier of these lizards leaky to horseradish peroxidase. An alternative route for extravasation of horseradish peroxidase, following injection of chameleons with 2.7 mg of D-glucose to render their brain capillaries leaky, is a system of transient cytoplasmic vesicles and vesiculo-tubular channels whose lumina may be open to the luminal or abluminal surface (or both) of the capillary endothelial cell. High voltage electron microscopy (HVEM) of 0.25 and 0.5 micron thick plastic sections of experimental brain capillary endothelium confirmed the existence of vesiculo-tubular conduits. These channels display a sigmoid morphology and are situated in the cytoplasm at angles oblique to the luminal and abluminal surfaces of the endothelium. Occasionally, the channels spanned the entire endothelial wall of the capillary, and in such cases, appeared to connect the lumen with the brain extracellular compartment. HVEM images (including stereo pairs) of the vesiculo-tubular channels show them to have a scalloped, irregular profile consistent with their proposed formation by fusion of pinocytotic vesicles. Also, HVEM examinations of experimental capillaries from peroxidase-treated lizards reveal massive quantities of dense reaction product in cytoplasmic vesicles and vesiculo-tubular membrane compartments of the endothelium, and the complex pleomorphism exhibited by these structures. Observations made in the present study suggest that as a consequence of severe hyperglycaemia, transendothelial channels form in the brain capillaries by fusion of pinocytotic vesicles generated by accelerated pinocytosis at the luminal surface of the endothelium, and subsequently serve as open routes for massive floods of tracer into the central nervous system.},

This heptadecapeptide, H-Asp-Thr-Met-Arg-Cys-Met-Val-Gly-Arg-Val-Tyr-Arg-Pro-Cys-Trp-Glu-Val-OH , stimulated melanosome concentration (centripetal aggregation) within melanophores of all species of teleost fishes studied. Melanosome aggregation in response to MCH was not blocked by Dibenamine as was the response to norepinephrine (NE), demonstrating that melanosome aggregating responses to MCH and NE are mediated through separate receptors. Melanosome aggregation in response to MCH was reversed by an equimolar concentration of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). In contrast, MCH stimulated melanosome dispersion (centrifugal movement) within melanophores of a frog (Rana pipiens) and a lizard (Anolis carolinensis). Therefore, MCH exhibits both melanosome concentrating and dispersing actions depending upon the species studied.},

	Abstract = {A reflectance method was utilized to compare the in vitro responses in three species of frogs (Rana pipiens, R. berlandieri forrei, and R. catesbeiana) and a lizard (Anolis carolinensis) to alpha- and beta-melanotropins (alpha- and beta p-MSH). The integumental chromatic response of the three ranid species was identical, in that alpha-MSH was about 2 times more potent than beta p-MSH. The melanotropins were equipotent in the lizard skin bioassay. A remarkable feature of the Anolis skin assay is that skins from this lizard can be utilized repeatedly many times in one day with an extremely high degree of precision. The reflectance method was also used to determine the in vivo potencies of alpha-MSH and beta p-MSH in the frog, R. pipiens. Surprisingly, the melanotropins were more active in the in vivo assay than in the in vitro bioassay. The darkening response of the frogs to alpha-MSH was reversed by 6 hr, but the response to beta p-MSH persisted for more than 8 hr. When alpha-MSH was incubated in frog serum, the melanotropic activity was almost totally abolished by 30 min, whereas the melanotropic activity of beta p-MSH was evident much longer (4 hr) in the presence of the serum. In light of the observation that the melanotropic activity of alpha-MSH is rapidly lost by incubation in frog serum, it is unclear why the hormone was more active as measured in vivo and why the darkening response in vivo persisted so long.},

	Abstract = {In reproductively responsive, male Anolis carolinensis undergoing artificially induced testicular recrudescence, unilateral orchidectomy of the left testis produced compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining testis. Testosterone inhibited this compensatory testicular hypertrophy on a weight basis, but did not reduce the rate of spermatogenic development. These results suggest that there is a mechanism of testosterone feedback in Anolis carolinensis that controls gonadotropin secretion during the recrudescent phase. In reproductively thermorefractory lizards, unilateral orchidectomy had no effect on the remaining testis. Administration of exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone to refractory animals increased testicular weight and stage of spermatogenic development. Sensitivity to gonadotropin, as well as failure of unilateral orchidectomy to produce compensatory hypertrophy in refractory male anoles, suggests that the control of the refractory period in A. carolinensis results from physiological mechanisms in the pituitary gland or brain rather than in the testis.},

	Abstract = {A calcium binding protein (CaBP) with an apparent relative molecular weight of 28,000 was localized in the kidney of Anolis carolinensis with antisera directed against vitamin D-dependent CaBP from either rat kidney (RRCaBP) or chick intestine (CICaBP). When extracts of female saurian kidneys were fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, both calcium binding activity, as measured by the chelex resin assay, and CaBP immunoreactivity, as measured by radioimmunoassay for RRCaBP, were observed near the 28,000-Da region similar to RRCaBP and CICaBP. Utilization of the immunoblot technique following SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis resulted in cross-reactivity for CaBP in the Mr 28,000 region for both rat and anolian kidneys. Immunoreactive CaBP was localized in the nephron using the unlabeled antibody peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. Distal tubules (DT) gave a strong, specific reaction with either antiserum, but not all cells of the DT reacted with equal intensity. Cells in the transition zone between the DT and the terminal tubules, and cells in the collecting tubules, were occasionally positive. Renal corpuscles, proximal tubules, and thin segments gave no specific localization of CaBP. The sexual segment of male kidneys was also negative. The results indicate that a calcium binding protein with an apparent molecular weight of 28K is highly conserved during vertebrate evolution, and thus may have widespread but specific functional significance. The localization of CaBP to the DT suggests that this protein may be involved in the selective reabsorption and/or excretion of calcium.},

	Abstract = {We have prepared several alpha-melanotropin (alpha-MSH) analogues with tyrosine substituted for methionine at the 4-position and determined their melanotropic activities on the frog (Rana pipiens), lizard (Anolis carolinensis) and S-91 (Cloudman) mouse melanoma adenylate cyclase bioassays. The potencies of Ac-[Tyr4]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 and Ac-[Tyr4]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 were compared with alpha-MSH and with their corresponding methionine and norleucine substituted analogues. The Tyr-4 analogues were found to be less active than the Nle-4 analogues on both the frog and lizard assays. Ac-[Tyr4]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 was found to be less active than Ac-[Tyr4]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 on the lizard bioassay, but more active than the longer fragment on the frog skin assay. Ac-[Tyr4]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 exhibited extremely prolonged biological activity on frog skin, but not on lizard skin, while the melanotropic activity of Ac-[Tyr4]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 was rapidly reversed on both assay systems. The increased potency of Ac-[Tyr4]-alpha-MSH4-10-NH2 over Ac-[Tyr4]-alpha-MSH4-11-NH2 on frog melanocytes may be related to the fact that the shorter 4-10 analogue exhibits prolonged biological activity. Interestingly, it was found that both Tyr-4 analogues were partial agonists on the mouse melanoma adenylate cyclase bioassay, and stimulated the enzyme to only about 50% of the maximal activity of alpha-MSH. We reported previously that replacement of L-Phe-7 by its D-enantiomer in [Nle4]-alpha-MSH and its Nle-4 containing analogues resulted in peptides with increased potency and in some instances prolonged activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Adult males of the small arboreal iguanid lizard, Anolis carolinensis, form social dominance hierarchies when placed in habitats with limited resources. Skin color changes occur during hierarchy formation, most conspicuously in subordinates, who appear darker (more brown) than dominants (more green). Because skin color in this species is under the control of hormones frequently associated with physiological stress, radioimmunoassay of plasma levels of the principal reptilian adrenal steroid, corticosterone, was performed. To examine the influence of gonadal androgen, known to influence the aggression that attends hierarchy formation, lizard pairs were constituted in which one or both members were castrated. Corticosterone levels of intact subordinates were significantly elevated, whereas those of castrated subordinates or dominants showed levels comparable to those of isolates. No significant differences in spermatogenic stage could be detected between intact dominants or subordinates.},

	Abstract = {Electrophoretic surveys of two lizard species were used to test hypotheses that relate levels of enzyme variability to enzyme function (single-substrate versus multiple-substrate enzymes, regulatory versus nonregulatory enzymes). Anolis roquet behaviorally regulates its body temperature, but its congener A. gundlachi is passive to variations in the thermal environment. As a result, populations of A. gundlachi probably experience the thermal environment as temporally coarse-grained, whereas populations of A. roquet do not. We therefore predicted that A. gundlachi would exhibit greater enzyme heterozygosity than A. roquet and that different enzyme classes would contribute disproportionately to this interspecific difference. The data show (1) that A. gundlachi does have a higher heterozygosity and (2) that this difference appears to result from high levels of heterozygosity at loci coding for multiple-substrate enzymes. The dichotomy between regulatory and nonregulatory enzymes offers no explanation for the variability in heterozygosity among enzyme loci in these species.},

	Abstract = {Excised dorsal skin of Anolis carolinensis was exposed to high intensity UV-irradiation in the presence of different photoreactive alpha-MSH derivatives. The resulting covalent binding of the hormone to its receptor induced irreversible pigment dispersion. The duration of the longlasting response depended on the type and length of irradiation; it was maximal after two 5 min irradiation phases with a light intensity of approximately 180 mW/cm2 and a spectrum from 310 to 550 nm, fresh hormone being added after the first phase. [N alpha-(4-Azidophenylacetyl-serine1]-alpha-MSH (I), [2'-(2-nitro-4-azidophenylsulphenyl)-tryptophan9]-alpha-MSH (II) and [p-azidophenylalanine13]-alpha-MSH (III) all inserted into the receptor to about the same extent, as judged from the persistence of the longlasting signal. In contrast, [D-alanine1, p-azidophenylalanine2, norvaline4]-alpha-MSH (IV) and [N alpha-(4-azidophenylacetyl)-serine1, leucine9]-alpha-MSH (V) gave much less insertion and [leucine9, p-azidophenylalanine13]-alpha-MSH (VI) hardly any insertion when applied in the same relative excess (5-fold the concentration inducing a maximal response). Covalent attachment of the cleavable photolabel [N alpha-(4-azidophenyl)-1, 3'-dithio-propionyl-serine1]-alpha-MSH (VII) and subsequent washing of the skin in buffer containing 1% beta-mercaptoethanol released the peptide from the receptor. Insertion of the C-terminal photolabel [p-azidophenylalanine13]-alpha-MSH was reduced by the weak antagonist H-Phe-Ala-Trp-Gly-Gly-Pro-Val-NH2. These experiments prove that hormone receptors can be covalently labelled in tissue with very limited light transparency.},

	Abstract = {The inhibitory effect of dopamine on the action of MSH on the Anolis melanophore is blocked by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine and compound RX 781094, suggesting that the action of dopamine is mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Apomorphine and sulpiride had no effect on MSH action nor the inhibitory effect of dopamine on MSH action confirming that the Anolis melanophore does not possess dopamine receptors and that the action of dopamine is not mediated by dopamine receptors. Since the kinetics of competition between dopamine and MSH is that described for a single receptor it is concluded that interpretation of classical kinetics of competition in terms of action at a single receptor site requires modification to include an unrelated action at separate receptors, competition occurring at a post-receptor level.},

Sections cut normal to the basal lamina and sections cut parallel to it were studied in order to establish the number, shape and distribution of the hemidesmosomes. Four basic types of hemidesmosome distribution were recognised among a limited representation of the classes studied. (1) Linear chains of hemidesmosomes (Mammalia, Rana, Bufo). (2) Rosette arrangement of hemidesmosomes surrounding pockets of basal plasma membrane (Avia, Anolis, Xenopus). (3) Punctate hemidesmosomes with no arrangement (Thamnophis). (4) Absence of hemidesmosomes (Carassius). All animals showed a basal lamina, basal pinocytotic vesicles, anchoring filaments, tonofilaments, and interdigitating foot-processes. It is suggested that anchoring filaments deserve to be studied more thoroughly in certain other types of epithelia which do not have focal hemidesmosomes, but require firm anchorage to a basal lamina.},

	Abstract = {Biological and radioimmunological assay methods were used in an attempt to detect and determine corticotrophic and melanotrophic activity in the pituitary gland and the central nervous system of the lamprey, Lampetra fluviatilis. The activities of various corticotrophin (1-39 ACTH)-related peptides in the cytochemical assay for ACTH could be readily distinguished on the basis of their dose-response lines. Extracts of the pituitary gland and brain but not of spinal cord were also active in this test. The dose-response lines of the pars distalis extracts were parallel with those of 1-39 ACTH; those of the neurointermediate lobe and the brain resembled des-Ac-alpha-MSH and alpha-MSH, respectively, although subsequent tests showed that the active molecules in the extracts differed from these standard peptides in other respects. Pituitary extracts were active in the Anolis bioassay for melanotrophin but not in a radioimmunoassay for alpha-MSH. Moreover, the electrophoretic Rf value of lamprey melanotrophic activity was distinct from both alpha-MSH and des-Ac-alpha-MSH. Brain extracts showed only low melanotrophic bioactivity and again no immunoreactivity. The results suggest that small amounts of corticotrophin occur in the pars distalis of the lamprey and that the melanotrophic factors in the neurointermediate lobe and brain are not identical to mammalian alpha-MSH and des-Ac-alpha-MSH.},

	Abstract = {The pineal organ of the lizard Anolis carolinensis can be maintained for up to 10 days in superfused organ culture. During this time it synthesizes and releases melatonin into the medium flowing slowly over it. Collection of timed aliquots of medium and subsequent analysis for melatonin by radioimmunoassay reveal circadian rhythms of melatonin output by the isolated pineal. These rhythms persist for many cycles in constant darkness and at several constant ambient temperatures ranging from 22 to 37 degrees C. The period of the rhythm is temperature compensated (Q10 approximately equal to 1.14) and the rhythm is synchronized by light-dark cycles imposed on the cultured gland. This isolated vertebrate organ displays the three major properties of circadian systems and must therefore contain one or more circadian oscillators.},

@article{Rhoten:1983aa,
	Abstract = {The biosynthesis of insulin, in particular the occurrence of a proinsulin-like molecule (PILM), in the pancreas of the green anole, Anolis carolinensis, was investigated. The laboratory rat was used for comparison and validation of the procedures. Anolian pancreases were incubated in vitro with radiolabeled leucine or proline. Radioactivity incorporated into the acidic ethanol-soluble (AES) phase increased in an essentially linear manner with time. Selective incorporation of labeled amino acids into AES material was not enhanced by a high concentration of glucose (6 mg/ml), by the addition of glucagon, which increases cyclic AMP levels, or by the addition of cytochalasin B; yet all three conditions result in stimulated insulin secretion. Gel filtration of the AES material on columns of Bio-Gel P-30 revealed a major peak of radioactivity whose apex followed closely the apogee of porcine proinsulin. When this presumptive PILM was treated with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B, the radioactivity was shifted towards later elution volumes, but the peak of the converted anolian material was not coincidental with marker insulin. Immunopurification techniques and additional molecular filtrations resulted in the isolation of fractions with both insulin-like immunoreactivity (IRI) and radioactivity derived from tritium-labeled leucine. One peak of radiolabel was present in the region of the proinsulin standards. The level of radioactivity in the region of the insulin standards was relatively high after two days of organ culture of splenic pancreases. By polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis proteins that incorporated radiolabeled amino acids and had insulin-like immunoreactivity possessed migration patterns similar to those of mammalian proinsulin and insulin. The insulin-like component was less readily demonstrated than the proinsulin-like component and raises the possibility that anolian PILM may be a major storage form in this species. The results are consistent with the synthesis of a proinsulin-like precursor in the beta cells of the green anole. The results also provide evidence for a precursor-product relationship in the anolian beta cell.},

@article{Jones:1983aa,
	Abstract = {The lizard Anolis carolinensis ovulates a single egg alternately from each ovary every 14 days. The ovulated egg enters the ipsilateral oviduct, acquires a shell, and is oviposited 18 or 19 days later. Thus, there is only a single egg in one of the oviducts (one-egg condition) during most of the estrous cycle, but there is a 4-5 day period when a mature, shelled egg is in one oviduct while a recently ovulated egg is in the contralateral oviduct (two-egg condition). Analysis of ovarian follicular diameters indicates that the largest follicle in a single ovary exhibits a growth spurt about halfway through its 28-day vitellogenic growth phase. The corpus luteum, once formed from the ovulated follicle, exhibits a linear decrease in weight, becoming fully regressed just before oviposition of the egg in the ipsilateral oviduct. Plasma concentrations of estradiol-17 beta and progesterone are high in two-egg animals. After oviposition, plasma concentrations of progesterone are still high in one-egg animals whereas those of estradiol-17 beta are much lower. These ovarian and hormonal changes during the estrous cycle are discussed in relation to the probable sources of estradiol-17 beta and progesterone, the control of the alternating pattern of ovulation and oviposition, and the role of steroid hormones in female sexual receptivity in this species.},

We tested the hypothesis that epinephrine-induced activation of beta-adrenoreceptors in the uterus inhibits AVT action on uterine smooth muscle. Pretreatment of gravid females with the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist dichloroisoproterenol 15 min before an AVT injection resulted in uterine sensitivity to AVT and subsequent oviposition. Furthermore, in vitro tests indicated that epinephrine as well as a beta-adrenoreceptor agonist (isoproterenol) inhibit uterine tonic and rhythmic contractions that normally follow exposure to AVT. These results suggest that stress-induced secretion of epinephrine can act as a short-term inhibitor of oviposition in this species.},

	Abstract = {Handling of autotomized, thrashing and autotomized, exhausted tails of the lizard Scincella lateralis by mammals and snakes was tested to examine the function of postautotomy tail movement. Tail movement attracted a mammal's attack to the tail, permitting the lizard to escape and increased the time required for a snake to subdue a tail before swallowing it, increasing the lizard's escape time by 40 percent. Lactate concentrations of autotomized tails after movement were compared to those of intact tails after rest in S. lateralis, a species with a high rate of autotomized tail thrashing, and Anolis carolinensis, a species with a low rate of thrashing. Postautotomy movement increased tail lactate concentration in both species, but mean tail lactate concentration in S. lateralis was 60 percent higher than that in A. carolinensis, and a third higher than that reportedfor whole-body lactate content of the very mobile lizard Dipsosaurus dorsalis.},

	Abstract = {In order to investigate the biosynthesis of alpha MSH and beta-endorphin in a non-mammalian vertebrate, individual lizard intermediate pituitaries were incubated in complete medium containing a radioactive amino acid, using either a steady label or a pulse/chase protocol. Following incubation, acid extracts of the tissue were immunoprecipitated with either an NH2-terminal ACTH antiserum or a beta-endorphin antiserum and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After a 24 hr steady label in medium containing [3H]tyrosine, multiple molecular weight forms of beta-endorphin-related and NH2-terminal ACTH-related radioactivity were detected. The major peak of beta-endorphin-related radioactivity co-migrated with synthetic beta-endorphin(1-31); minor peaks of beta LPH-sized material and precursor-sized material were also detected. The major peak of NH2-terminal ACTH-related material co-migrated with synthetic alpha MSH; in addition, smaller amounts of material designated ACTH biosynthetic intermediate 1, ACTH biosynthetic intermediate 2, and precursor-sized material were detected. Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the precursor-sized material had antigenic determinants for both alpha MSH and beta-endorphin. Pulse/chase experiments established that this material is the common precursor for alpha MSH and beta-endorphin. Based on gel filtration chromatography in 6 M guanidine HCl, the molecular weights of these various peptides are: common precursor, 23,300 daltons; ACTH biosynthetic intermediate 1, 12,200 daltons; ACTH biosynthetic intermediate 2, 4,200 daltons; alpha MSH, 1,500 daltons; beta LPH, 8000 daltons; beta-endorphin, 3,400 daltons. None of the peptides precipitated with either antiserum incorporated [3H]glucosamine; thus glycosylation does not appear to be involved in this biosynthetic pathway in the lizard. The results of the kinetic experiments and molecular weight determinations indicate that the major biosynthetic pathway involves the following events: common precursor is first cleaved to yield ACTH biosynthetic intermediate 1 plus beta LPH; subsequently, beta LPH is cleaved to produce beta-endorphin; ACTH biosynthetic intermediate 1 is cleaved to produce ACTH biosynthetic intermediate 2 which is subsequently cleaved to produce alpha MSH. The pulse/chase experiments indicate minor pathways exist for cleaving beta-endorphin directly from the common precursor or via a high molecular weight form intermediate in size between the common precursor and beta LPH.},

	Abstract = {Immunohistochemical studies on the pituitary of Anolis carolinensis detected ACTH-like, beta-endorphin-like, and 16K fragment-like immunoreactivity in distinct clusters of cells in the anterior lobe; ACTH-like, alpha MSH-like, beta-endorphin-like, and 16K fragment-like immunoreactivity was detected in all the cells of the intermediate lobe. Crude acid extracts of both lobes, when analyzed by radioimmunoassay, gave displacement curves in ACTH and beta-endorphin assays which were parallel to the appropriate synthetic standard. Only extracts of the intermediate lobe gave parallel displacement curves in an alpha MSH radioimmunoassay. Extracts of both lobes crossreacted with antiserum to 16K fragment, but the displacement curves were not parallel to that of mouse 16K fragment standard. The levels of immunoreactive ACTH and beta-endorphin in the intermediate lobe were approximately 8-fold higher than in the anterior lobe. Fractionation of anterior lobe and intermediate lobe extracts by either gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 in 10% formic acid or sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed multiple forms of ACTH-related and beta-endorphin-related substances in both lobes. In the anterior lobe the major forms of immunoreactivity were, respectively, ACTH-sized and beta-endorphin-sized. In the intermediate lobe the major forms of immunoreactivity were alpha MSH-sized, CLIP-sized, and beta-endorphin-sized. In both lobes, antisera directed against ACTH and beta-endorphin detected high molecular weight material with an apparent molecular weight slightly less than that of mouse pro-ACTH/endorphin; this material probably represents the putative common precursor for ACTH and beta-endorphin in this species.},

	Abstract = {Population experiments with Anolis lizard species demonstrate a relation between the amount of between-species competition and the degree of interspecific resource partitioning (the more the partitioning the less the competition). Specifically, the amount of resource partitioning between the two species (Anolis gingivinus and Anolis wattsi pogus) on the island of St. Maarten is less than that between the two species (Anolis bimaculatus and Anolis wattsi schwartzi) on the island of St. Eustatius. The presence of Anolis wattsi both lowers the growth rates and raises the perch heights of Anolis gingivinus individuals. In contrast, Anolis wattsi has no effect on Anolis bimaculatus. Thus, when there is less resource partitioning, Anolis wattsi has a greater competitive effect. This verifies, for these species, a central assumption of competition theory: the strength of between-species competition is inversely related to the amount of interspecific resource partitioning.},

In June, during the breeding season, 60 male and 60 female lizards were injected with 0.1 mg/kg of MIF-I or naloxone or the diluent vehicle and placed in small aquaria for ten minutes. TI was then induced in the small aquaria. Similar experiments were conducted in September and October (non-breeding season). There was a reduction in TI durations in MIF-I and naloxone-treated lizards of both sexes in June, but the differences between drug treatment groups and controls were not significant. In September and October, MIF-I treatment resulted in TI durations similar to controls but naloxone treatment resulted in slightly shorter durations. Increased TI duration in females as compared to males was seen during both seasons, but diminished during the breeding season. Weight was found to be a factor in male lizards, with males greater than or equal to 4.0 g showing significantly longer TI durations. The lack of a significant effect of MIF-I on TI durations during the breeding season is possibly due to changes in the experimental design from the earlier report.},

	Abstract = {Melanocyte-stimulating activity in the pituitary and plasma of fetal, newborn and adult guinea-pigs, and in amniotic fluid, was bioassayed on isolated Anolis skin. In the fetuses, levels in the posterior, anterior and whole pituitary increased exponentially between 39 and 70 days of gestation; in all cases, the increases were close to 35-fold in terms of ng/lobe, and 6-fold in ng/mg of lyophilized tissue. The increases were due to growth, and to an increased accumulation within the tissues. Ratios of activity in the posterior pituitary: anterior pituitary: hypothalamus approximated 200:30:1 (ng/mg of dry tissue). Fetal plasma levels showed some scatter; however, there were no trends with age, and the average value (10.0 +/- 1.6 ng/ml) was close to that of the mothers (10.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml). Plasma activity appeared to fall markedly around birth; newborn pups, 2-6 hours after birth, showed levels 65% below those of the fetuses, and also below those of the adults (significant; P less than 0.05). At the same time the pituitary levels increased; this suggested a shut-down in release. The possible implications of this in the birth processes are discussed. Amniotic fluid showed only low, inconsistent activity, below 1% of plasma levels.},

	Abstract = {alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-melanotropin; alpha-MSH) is a linear tridecapeptide (Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2) that reversibly darkens amphibian skins by stimulating melanomsome (pigment granule) dispersion within melanophores. By using a number of in vitro melanocyte assays, we have examined the conformational requirements for alpha-MSH activity. Synthesis of [half-Cys4,half-Cys10]-alpha-MSH, a cyclic, conformationally restricted, "isosteric" analogue of alpha-MSH, provided a melanotropin with a potency greater than 10,000 times that of the native hormone in stimulating frog (Rana pipiens) skin darkening. The cyclic analogue also showed substantially prolonged activity relative to the native hormone. [half-Cys4,half-Cys10]-alpha-MSH was approximately 30 times more potent than alpha-MSH in stimulating lizard (Anolis carolinensis) skin melanophores in vitro. By using a cell-free Cloudman S-91 mouse melanoma plasma membrane preparation, we found the cyclic analogue to be approximately 3 times as potent as the native hormone in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity. These results provide insight into the conformational requirements for biological activity of alpha-MSH, and the comparative conformational requirements of alpha-MSH at a number of pigment cell receptors.},

	Abstract = {The differentiation of the pancreatic endocrine cells in the lizard Anolis carolinensis following oviposition was examined. Immediately postoviposition (PO) there was no apparent differentiation of epithelioid cells into endocrine or exocrine components. Individual subpopulations of the endocrine-like cells, which could not be identified during the early PO period on the basis of either their tinctorial properties at the light-microscopic level or their granule morphologies at the electron-microscopic level, exhibited specific hormonal localization by peroxidase-antiperoxidase complex immunocytochemistry. All four hormones searched for, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide (PP), were present in epithelioid cells shortly after oviposition. However, the immunostained secretory granules in the early PO period were smaller than those of the adult. Secretory granule morphologies that are typical of the adult were acquired at different times during development. Delta granules were observed first and were followed by alpha granules, and beta granules which appeared shortly before birth. The secretory granules of the PP-containing F cells could not be readily placed within this maturation sequence. Mosaic cells (containing more than one hormone) were not seen. Levels of immunoreactive insulin and glucagon in the pancreas increased several fold from day 10 to day 28 PO, but the attainment of adult beta-granule morphologies did not appear to be directly related to insulin itself. The results show that cytodifferentiation of the anolian endocrine pancreas occurs postoviposition and that immunocytochemical methods can be used to follow an organelle sequence during development. These findings suggest that subcellular organelles undergo structural remodeling during maturation which, at least in the case of secretory granules, may have functional significance.},

The effect of LPH37-58 was additive to that of alpha-MSH, indicating that LPH37-58 is a full agonist of alpha-MSH. The lower potency peptides des-acetyl MSH and gamma-MSH reduced the effect of alpha-MSH and are, therefore, partial agonists of alpha-MSH.

	Abstract = {1 The primary effect of catecholamines was to lighten Anolis skin previously darkened by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). In concentrations above 10(-7) M noradrenaline, 10(-6) M adrenaline and 10(-5) dopamine, darkening of subpopulations of melanophores occurred. Subsequent experiments were concerned with the effect of low catecholamine concentrations on alpha-MSH action. 2 The relationship between MSH receptors and alpha-adrenoceptors on the Anolis melanophore was studied by a kinetic approach using the rate bioassay method and by use of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. 3 alpha-MSH dose-response curves were shifted, in parallel, to the right in the presence of the catecholamines, noradrenaline, adrenaline and dopamine, and Lineweaver-Burke plots and Arunlakshana-Schild plots indicated that the catecholamines antagonized MSH action by a competitive mechanism. 4 Phentolamine had an inhibitory effect on the action of adrenaline but not on the action of MSH. Therefore MSH and catecholamine actions were mediated by separate receptors. 5 The classical kinetics of competition are not confined to competition at a single receptor. 6 The alpha-adrenoceptor was defined as the alpha 2-subtype since (a) the alpha 2-selective agonist, clonidine, was found to mimic catecholamine action. (b) The alpha 2-selective antagonist, yohimbine, blocked the actions of clonidine and adrenaline. (c) The alpha 1-selective antagonist, prazosin, had negligible blocking effects on adrenaline and clonidine. 7 We conclude that a close association exists between the separate MSH receptor and alpha 2-adrenoceptor on the Anolis melanophore. The competition that takes place between MSH and catecholamines must occur after hormone-receptor interaction, possibly through a common adenylate cyclase moiety oppositely controlled by the two receptors involved.},

	Abstract = {Autoradiographic studies with {$[$}3H{$]$}estradiol-17 beta in red-eared turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans) show concentration and retention of radioactivity in nuclei of neurons in certain regions. Accumulations of estrogen target neurons exist in the periventricular brain with relationships to ventral extensions of the forebrain ventricles, including parolfactory, amygdaloid, septal, preoptic, hypothalamic and thalamic areas, as well as the dorsal ventricular ridge, the piriform cortex, and midbrain-pontine periaqueductal structures. The general anatomical pattern of distribution of estrogen target neurons corresponds to those observed not only in another reptile (Anolis carolinensis), but also in birds and mammals, as well as in teleosts and cyclostomes. In Pseudemys, which appears to display an intermediate degree of phylogenetic differentiation, the amygdaloid-septal-preoptic groups of estrogen target neurons constitute a continuum. In phylogenetic ascendency, e.g. in mammals, these cell populations are increasingly separated and distinct, while in phylogenetic descendency, e.g. in teleosts and cyclostomes, an amygdaloid group appears to be absent or contained within the septal-preoptic target cell population.},

	Abstract = {Cytosol binding sites for the synthetic progestin {$[$}3H{$]$}R5020 have been identified in the brain and oviduct from untreated and estrogen primed ovariectomized female lizards (Anolis carolinensis). Competition of various unlabeled steroids at either 10 nM (brain) or 10 and 100 nM (oviduct) revealed that progestins were effective competitors whereas two glucocorticoids as well as testosterone and estradiol were ineffective. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of the receptor for [3H]R5020 in the hypothalamus and telencephalon of the brain was determined to be 0.7-0.8 nM. The concentration of binding sites in the hypothalamus was approximately twice as great as in the telencephalon. The dissociation constant of the binding site for [3H]R5020 in the oviduct was determined to be 1.4-1.7 nM. Although sucrose density gradient centrifugation of brain cytosols labeled with [3H]R5020 failed to reveal a discretely sedimenting peak of radioactivity, oviduct cytosol gradients contained two broad peaks of [3H]R5020 binding at 3-6S and 8-9S. The concentration of [3H]R5020 binding sites in both the oviduct and hypothalamus was found to increase after estrogen treatment. Scatchard analysis of oviduct cytosol [3H]R5020 binding showed that estrogen priming increased binding levels 3-fold. Single point assays with 0.4 nM [3H]R5020 demonstrated that estrogen priming increased binding by 55% in hypothalamus but did not alter binding in cytosol from the telencephalon sample. These results suggest that the [3H]R5020 binding sites identified in the brain and oviduct of the lizard A. carolinensis may correspond to cytoplasmic progestin receptors. Furthermore, the finding of an estrogen-induced increase in the concentration of these receptors in the hypothalamus and oviduct indicate that the capability of estrogen to modulate the concentration of progestin receptor is present in a representative of a vertebrate class whose progenitors gave rise to birds and mammals.},

	Abstract = {A single injection of the melanotropin analog {$[$}4-norleucine, 7-D-phenylalanine]-alpha-melanotropin into frogs (Rana pipiens) caused near maximum darkening of the skins of the frogs for at least 6 weeks. Injections of the natural hormone alpha-melanotropin or of the analog [Nle4]-alpha-melanotropin also caused darkening, but this effect lasted only a few days. Morphological examination of the skins of frogs injected with [Nle4, D-Phe7]-alpha-melanotropin revealed that both dermal and epidermal melanophores were dispersed during the entire 6-week period. In vitro [Nle4, D-Phe7]-alpha-melanotropin also causes prolonged darkening of the skin of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. In the absence of the melanotropin, skins previously darkened with the analog could be lightened by removal of calcium from the incubation medium but could then be redarkened by adding calcium. The cycle could be repeated indefinitely without addition of melanotropin. These results demonstrate the role of calcium in receptor signal transduction and the prolonged biological effects of [Nle4, D-Phe7]-alpha-melanotropin long after its removal from the assay medium.},

	Abstract = {Prostaglandins (PGs) have been implicated in the mediation of sexual behavior in vertebrates. In this study, the effects of administered PGs on sexual receptivity were examined in the ovariectomized female green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). Injection (ip) of 15 microgram PGF2 alpha failed to induce sexual receptivity in nonreceptive females which were either untreated or estrogen primed. On the other hand, PGF2 alpha treatment of sexually receptive estrogen-pretreated females inhibited sexual receptivity 1 h post injection. A dose of 7.5 microgram PGF2 alpha was as effective as 15 microgram in inhibiting sexual receptivity, while a dose of 1.5 microgram was near the minimum effective level. Treatment with 15 microgram PGE2 and, to a lesser extent, PGE1 also reduced sexual receptivity. In contrast, arginine-8-vasotocin, a neuropeptide capable of stimulating smooth muscle contractions in reptiles, did not decrease sexual receptivity. The inhibitory effects of PG treatment observed at 1 h were diminished by 3 h and were no longer present 6 and 24 h post injection, with females, again, being fully receptive. Inhibition of sexual receptivity occurs very rapidly after PGF2 alpha treatment. When tested 5 min post injection, all females treated with 15 microgram arginine-8-vasotocin were sexually receptive. The oviducts were not required for PGF2 alpha inhibition of sexual receptivity, as sexual receptivity was inhibited in oviductectomized females 1 h after the injection of 15 microgram PGF2 alpha. The inhibitory action of PGF2 alpha was also observed when sexually receptive females were injected intracranially rather than ip. Intracranial injection of 3.8 microgram PGF2 alpha inhibited sexual receptivity in females tested 1 h post injection. These results indicate that exogenous PGs, possibly acting centrally within the brain, inhibit sexual receptivity in female A. carolinensis, a species with a rapid mating-induced termination of sexual receptivity.},

The experimental animal was a 3.5 g lizard (Anolis carolinensis) whose metabolic rate is about equal to man's. Lizards were injected with one of the mixes, at intervals some were killed and homogenized, and the free amino acids were assayed on protein-free filtrates of the entire carcass. Amino acids disappeared from complete and incomplete mixes at the same rate, a rate several-fold greater than that at which they could be catabolized. When three or five essential amino acids (as defined for the growing rat) were injected by themselves, they were removed only one-third as fast as when accompanied by a balanced mix of the rest of the protein components. I concluded that if the amino acids were in proper ratio and if they were sufficient in number, they were removed rapidly even though as many as five essential amino acids are missing. For want of a better explanation, some type of macromolecule synthesis from balanced incomplete mixes was postulated.},

	Abstract = {The topographical distribution of enkephalin in the central nervous system of the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, has been studied by the immunoperoxidase technique with antiserum to leucine-enkephalin. Immunoreactive enkephalin perikarya, fibers and probably terminals are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, which agrees well with the distribution of enkephalins in the mammalian brain. Enkephalin-containing perikarya are found in the subpallium (septum, nucleus accumbens, striatum, amydgala), preoptic and hypothalamic region, ventromedial nucleus and ventromedial area of thalamus, pretectal geniculate nucleus and posterodorsal nucleus of pretectum, nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, locus ceruleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, medial parvocellular nucleus, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Enkephalinergic fibers and terminals are found in the above-mentioned areas as well as in the pallium (medial and dorsal cortex, dorsal ventricular ridge), dorsomedial and anterior dorsolateral nucleus of the thalamus, habenula, nucleus of the stria medullaris, torus semicircularis, mesencephalic tegmental area, interpeduncular nucleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, central gray, reticular formation, raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, isthmus region, and nucleus of the trapezoid body. Enkephalinergic pathways appear to exist between the septum and the medial cortex, nucleus accumbens and nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, striatum and certain mesencephalic structures, hypothalamus and tegmentum, and between nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and torus semicircularis. In the pituitary, cells of the pars intermedia, and certain cells of the rostral pars distalis also show immunoreactivity to enkephalin antiserum. The distribution of enkephalin immunoreactivity throughout the hypothalamus and in the median eminence suggests involvement in neuroendocrine regulation. Presence of enkephalin in many extrahypothalamic brain areas indicates its important role in various sensory functions and in behavioral and autonomic integration.},

	Abstract = {The seasonal variation in pituitary gonadotropin in the adult male newt, Cynops pyrrhogaster pyrrhogaster was investigated by means of isoelectric focusing (IEF) coupled with radioreceptor assay (RRA), which employed Anolis or Xenopus testicular homogenates as receptors and 125I-rat FSH as radioligand. In the Anolis RRA system, the standard curve was obtained with 0.125-16 ng/tube of NIAMDD rat FSH I-3. Purified preparations, chicken LH IEF-1, chicken FSH AGCHD11113A and bullfrog basic gonadotropin-IV competitively inhibited the binding of the radioligand, but NIAMDD rat LH I-4 and human chorionic gonadotropin did not crossreact. The autoradiographic study revealed that 125I-rat FSH bound to the constituent cells of the seminiferous tubules in the Anolis testis, but scarcely to Leydig cells. In the IEF pattern of gonadotropin in February obtained by Anolis RRA, distinct peaks were observed at pH 9.05 (component B) and 8.55 (component C), and less distinct peaks were observed at pH 9.80 (component A), 7.55 (component D) and 7.05 (component E). When the same fractions were assayed by Xenopus RRA, five components were found in the alkaline region, which corresponded to those observed with Anolis RRA. Similar results were obtained with pituitary extracts in May. In July, the IEF pattern obtained by Anolis RRA indicated two additional components at pH 6.30 (component F) and 5.27 (component G) in the acidic region, which were not found by Xenopus RRA. The relationship between the testicular function and the nature of pituitary gonadotropin in the reproductive cycle was discussed.},

	Abstract = {A study was made of changes in skin colour in the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, in response to deep electrical stimulation at 0.2 mm intervals throughout the periventricular region of the diencephalon and the anterior brain stem. Double-barrelled glass microelectrodes with tip diameters of 3 microns were used. A 20 microA pulse-train consisting of a 500 Hz signal lasting for 1 s yielded localized responses. Skin darkening occurred only in response to stimulation delivered in the anterior and dorsal region of the diencephalon and skin lightening only in response to stimulation in a small area in the posterior and ventral region of the hypothalamus. Electrical lesions in the latter region resulted in permanent skin darkening. Surgical interruption of the hypothalamo-hypophysial neurosecretory tract did not block skin-colour change in response to dark or light backgrounds. It was concluded that MSH release is under tonic inhibitory control by hypothalamic neurones in Anolis. Both inhibitory and stimulatory neurones can be localized stereotaxically in the diencephalon and neither type corresponds with the neurosecretory neurones of the hypothalamo-hypophysial tract. The functional relationship between the stimulatory neurones and the inhibitory neurones and pars intermedia remains unclear.},

	Abstract = {The retinas of 14 ecologically diverse species of Anolis lizards have been examined neuroanatomically. Both central and temporal foveas were observed in each eye of all species: however, the two foveas differed with regard to a number of structural and morphological characteristics. All central foveas were deep and convexiclivate, while temporal foveas were shallower and more variable both in shape and retinal location across species. Central foveas had higher cell densities and a broader foveal clivus than did temporal foveas both within and across species. As eye size increased across species, densities of receptor nuclei per visual degree2 (vis. deg.2) increased more rapidly than did ganglion cell densities/vis, deg.2 in the central fovea. In contrast, both cell types increased at approximately the same rate in the temporal fovea as eye size increased. Several of these relationships have been previously reported for diurnal birds of prey, which are also bifoveate. of stomach contents revealed that Anolis species which feed upon small prey items have temporal foveas with a relatively deep clivus. Foveal characteristics may influence both species typical foraging behaviors and the type of prey which can be effectively utilized by a given species.},

	Abstract = {The biological and behavioral activities of gamma-MSH (gamma-MSH) and alpha-MSH (alpha-MSH) were compared using three different tests: darkening of the skin of Anolis, grooming behavior of rats, and performance of a visual discrimination task by rats. When incubated with the Anolis skin, both peptides cause skin darkening. However, alpha-MSH is much more potent than gamma-MSH. The alpha-MSH effect is not antagonized by coincubation with gamma-MSH. When given intraventricularly to rats, alpha-MSH induces a marked grooming behavior. This effect was not noted upon administration of gamma-MSH. Injection of gamma-MSH with the alpha-MSH did not produce a grooming response significantly different from alpha-MSH alone. In the visual discrimination task, the two peptides had opposite effects on the rate at which rats learned the initial discrimination and a subsequent reversal. The peptides were injected intraperitoneally prior to behavioral testing. Following alpha-MSH, rats learned the discrimination and subsequent reversal faster than the control rats. Following gamma-MSH, rats learned the initial discrimination at approximately the same rate as controls, and learned the reversal much slower. These results are discussed in terms of the similarity and differences in the mechanisms of action of alpha-MSH and gamma-MSH.},

	Abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is widespread and substantial throughout the animal world. It is surprising, then, that such a pervasive source of biological diversity has not been integrated into studies of adaptive radiation, despite extensive and growing attention to both phenomena. Rather, most studies of adaptive radiation either group individuals without regard to sex or focus solely on one sex. Here we show that sexual differences contribute substantially to the ecomorphological diversity produced by the adaptive radiations of West Indian Anolis lizards: within anole species, males and females occupy mostly non-overlapping parts of morphological space; the overall extent of sexual variation is large relative to interspecific variation; and the degree of variation depends on ecological type. Thus, when sexual dimorphism in ecologically relevant traits is substantial, ignoring its contribution may significantly underestimate the adaptive component of evolutionary radiation. Conversely, if sexual dimorphism and interspecific divergence are alternative means of ecological diversification, then the degree of sexual dimorphism may be negatively related to the extent of adaptive radiation.},

	Abstract = {Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles are thought to have diversified through natural selection on body size and shape, presumably due to interspecific competition and variation in locomotor performance. Here we measure natural selection on body size over three years and across seven replicate populations of the brown anole, A. sagrei. We experimentally manipulated an important component of the environment (population density) on several small islands to test the role of density in driving natural selection. Results indicate that the strength of natural selection was proportional to population density (r2 = 0.81), and favored larger body sizes at higher density, presumably owing to the enhanced competitive ability afforded by large size. Changes in the distribution of body size by selective releases of lizards to islands show that this effect did not arise by pure density dependence, since smaller individuals were disproportionately selected against at higher densities. We measured significant broad sense heritability for body size in the laboratory (h2 = 0.55) indicating that selection in the wild could have an evolutionary response. Our results suggest an important effect of population density on natural selection in Anolis lizards.},

	Abstract = {Major abiotic disturbance can be an important factor influencing food-web dynamics, particularly in areas impacted by the recent increase in hurricane activity. We present a unique set of data on key food-web processes occurring on 10 small islands for three relatively calm years and then four subsequent years during which two hurricanes passed directly over the study site. Herbivory, as measured by leaf damage, was 3.2 times higher in the year after the first hurricane (2000) than in the previous year and was 1.7 times higher in the year after the second hurricane (2002) than in 2001. The effect of a top predator (the lizard, Anolis sagrei) on herbivory strengthened continuously after the first hurricane and overall was 2.4 times stronger during the disturbance period than before. Overall abundance of lizards was 30% lower during the disturbance period than before, and abundances of web spiders and hymenopteran parasitoids were 66% and 59% lower, respectively. We suggest that increased herbivory observed on all islands was caused, at least in part, by the overall reduction in predation by both lizards and arthropods, whereas magnification of the lizard effect on herbivory was caused by reduced compensatory predation by arthropods.},

@article{Holmes:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) possess two sexually dimorphic neuromuscular systems involved in reproductive behaviors. One controls extension of a red throat fan (dewlap), which males employ during courtship, and the other controls intromission of copulatory organs (hemipenes). Although seasonal changes in circulating androgens mediate both courtship and copulatory behaviors, testosterone has differential effects on the underlying neuromuscular morphology. The present experiments were designed to test whether changes in muscle fiber type correspond to seasonal and androgenic regulation of reproductive behaviors in gonadally intact males (Experiment 1) or castrated males treated with either testosterone propionate or vehicle (Experiment 2). Gonadally intact males housed in breeding environmental conditions had a higher percentage of fast oxidative glycolytic fibers in the dewlap muscle than non-breeding males, but no effect of season on copulatory fibers was detected. Interestingly, testosterone treatment increased the percentage of fast oxidative glycolytic dewlap fibers independent of season, suggesting that routine changes in this hormone may mediate fiber type in gonadally intact males. In contrast, testosterone manipulation had little to no effect on copulatory muscle fiber type, demonstrating that a change in this feature is not the primary mediator for seasonal changes in male copulatory behaviors.},

@article{Ciuraszkiewicz:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Transferrins, found in invertebrates and vertebrates, form a physiologically important family of proteins playing a major role in iron acquisition and transport, defense against microbial pathogens, growth and differentiation. These proteins are bilobal in structure and each lobe is composed of two domains divided by a cleft harboring an iron atom. Vertebrate transferrins comprise of serotransferrins, lactoferrins and ovotransferrins. In mammals serotransferrins transport iron in physiological fluids and deliver it to cells, while lactoferrins scavenge iron, limiting its availability to invading microbes. In oviparous vertebrates there is only one transferrin gene, expressed either in the liver to be delivered to physiological fluids as serotransferrin, or in the oviduct with a final localization in egg white as ovotransferrin. Being products of one gene sero- and ovotransferrin are identical at the amino-acid sequence level but with different, cell specific glycosylation patterns. Our knowledge of the mechanisms of transferrin iron binding and release is based on sequence and structural data obtained for human serotransferrin and hen and duck ovotransferrins. No sequence information about other ovotransferrins was available until our recent publication of turkey, ostrich, and red-eared turtle (TtrF) ovotransferrin mRNA sequences [Ciuraszkiewicz, J., Olczak, M., Watorek, W., 2006. Isolation, cloning and sequencing of transferrins from red-eared turtle, African ostrich and turkey. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 143 B, 301-310]. In the present paper, ten new reptilian mRNA transferrin sequences obtained from the Nile crocodile (NtrF), bearded dragon (BtrF), Cuban brown anole (AtrF), veiled and Mediterranean chameleons (VtrF and KtrF), sand lizard (StrF), leopard gecko (LtrF), Burmese python (PtrF), African house snake (HtrF), and grass snake (GtrF) are presented and analyzed. Nile crocodile and red-eared turtle transferrins have a disulphide bridge pattern identical to known bird homologues. A partially different disulphide bridge pattern was found in the Squamata (snakes and lizards). The possibility of a unique interdomain disulphide bridge was predicted for LtrF. Differences were found in iron-binding centers from those of previously known transferrins. Substitutions were found in the iron-chelating residues of StrF and TtrF and in the synergistic anion-binding residues of NtrF. In snakes, the transferrin (PtrF, HtrF and GtrF) N-lobe "dilysine trigger" occurring in all other known transferrins was not found, which indicates a different mechanism of iron release.},

	Abstract = {Islands have long provided material and inspiration for the study of evolution and ecology. The West Indies are complex historically and geographically, providing a rich backdrop for the analysis of colonization, diversification and extinction of species. They are sufficiently isolated to sustain endemic forms and close enough to sources of colonists to develop a dynamic interaction with surrounding continental regions. The Greater Antilles comprise old fragments of continental crust, some very large; the Lesser Antilles are a more recent volcanic island arc, and the low-lying Bahama Islands are scattered on a shallow oceanic platform. Dating of island lineages using molecular methods indicates over-water dispersal of most inhabitants of the West Indies, although direct connections with what is now southern Mexico in the Early Tertiary, and subsequent land bridges or stepping stone islands linking to Central and South America might also have facilitated colonization. Species-area relationships within the West Indies suggest a strong role for endemic radiations and extinction in shaping patterns of diversity. Diversification is promoted by opportunities for allopatric divergence between islands, or within the large islands of the Greater Antilles, with a classic example provided by the Anolis lizards. The timing of colonization events using molecular clocks permits analysis of colonization-extinction dynamics by means of species accumulation curves. These indicate low rates of colonization and extinction for reptiles and amphibians in the Greater Antilles, with estimated average persistence times of lineages in the West Indies exceeding 30Myr. Even though individual island populations of birds might persist an average of 2Myr on larger islands in the Lesser Antilles, recolonization from within the archipelago appears to maintain avian lineages within the island chain indefinitely. Birds of the Lesser Antilles also provide evidence of a mass extinction event within the past million years, emphasizing the time-heterogeneity of historical processes. Geographical dynamics are matched by ecological changes in the distribution of species within islands over time resulting from adaptive radiation and shifts in habitat, often following repeatable patterns. Although extinction is relatively infrequent under natural conditions, changes in island environments as a result of human activities have exterminated many populations and others--especially old, endemic species--remain vulnerable. Conservation efforts are strengthened by recognition of aesthetic, cultural and scientific values of the unique flora and fauna of the West Indies.},

	Abstract = {Successful social behavior can directly influence an individual's reproductive success. Therefore, many organisms readily modify social behavior based on past experience. The neural changes induced by social experience, however, remain to be fully elucidated. We hypothesize that social modulation of neural systems not only occurs at the level of individual nuclei, but also of functional networks, and their relationships with behavior. We used the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis), which displays stereotyped, visually triggered social behaviors particularly suitable for comparisons of multiple functional networks in a social context, to test whether repeated aggressive interactions modify behavior and metabolic activity in limbic-hypothalamic and sensory forebrain regions, assessed by quantitative cytochrome oxidase (a slowly accumulating endogenous metabolic marker) histochemistry. We found that aggressive interactions potentiate aggressive behavior, induce changes in activities of individual nuclei, and organize context-specific functional neural networks. Surprisingly, this experiential effect is not only present in a limbic-hypothalamic network, but also extends to a sensory forebrain network directly relevant to the behavioral expression. Our results suggest that social experience modulates organisms' social behavior via modifying sensory and limbic neural systems in parallel both at the levels of individual regions and networks, potentially biasing perceptual as well as limbic processing.},

	Abstract = {We compare lizard assemblages of Cerrado and Amazonian savannas to test the ecological release hypothesis, which predicts that niche dimensions and abundance should be greater in species inhabiting isolated habitat patches with low species richness (Amazonian savannas and isolated Cerrado patches) when compared with nonisolated areas in central Cerrado with greater species richness. We calculated microhabitat and diet niche breadths with data from 14 isolated Cerrado patches and Amazon savanna areas and six central Cerrado populations. Morphological data were compared using average Euclidean distances, and lizard abundance was estimated using the number of lizards captured in pitfall traps over an extended time period. We found no evidence of ecological release with respect to microhabitat use, suggesting that historical factors are better microhabitat predictors than ecological factors. However, data from individual stomachs indicate that ecological release occurs in these areas for one species (Tropidurus) but not others (Ameiva ameiva, Anolis, Cnemidophorus, and Micrablepharus), suggesting that evolutionary lineages respond differently to environmental pressures, with tropidurids being more affected by ecological factors than polychrotids, teiids, and gymnophthalmids. We found no evidence that ecological release occurs in these areas using morphological data. Based on abundance data, our results indicate that the ecological release (density compensation) hypothesis is not supported: lizard species are not more abundant in isolated areas than in nonisolated areas. The ecology of species is highly conservative, varying little from assemblage to assemblage. Nevertheless, increases in niche breadth for some species indicate that ecological release occurs as well.},

@article{Newman:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Endocannabinoids (eCBs) inhibit neurotransmitter release throughout the central nervous system. Using the Ceratomandibularis muscle from the lizard Anolis carolinensis we asked whether eCBs play a similar role at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. We report here that the CB(1) cannabinoid receptor is concentrated on motor terminals and that eCBs mediate the inhibition of neurotransmitter release induced by the activation of M(3) muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3 -carboxamide, a CB(1) antagonist, prevents muscarine from inhibiting release and arachidonylcyclopropylamide (ACPA), a CB(1) receptor agonist, mimics M(3) activation and occludes the effect of muscarine. As for its mechanism of action, ACPA reduces the action-potential-evoked calcium transient in the nerve terminal and this decrease is more than sufficient to account for the observed inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Similar to muscarine, the inhibition of synaptic transmission by ACPA requires nitric oxide, acting via the synthesis of cGMP and the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is responsible for the majority of the effects of eCB as inhibitors of phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase, two enzymes responsible for synthesis of 2-AG, significantly limit muscarine-induced inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Lastly, the injection of (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-N-(4-hydroxy-2-methylphenyl)-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenamide (an inhibitor of eCB transport) into the muscle prevents muscarine, but not ACPA, from inhibiting ACh release. These results collectively lead to a model of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction whereby 2-AG mediates the muscarine-induced inhibition of ACh release. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of this model we show that the CB(1) antagonist N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3 -carboxamide prevents synaptic inhibition induced by 20 min of 1-Hz stimulation.},

@article{Kolbe:2007aa,
	Abstract = {The biological invasion of the lizard Anolis sagrei provides an opportunity to study evolutionary mechanisms that produce morphological differentiation among non-native populations. Because the A. sagrei invasion represents multiple native-range source populations, differential admixture as well as random genetic drift and natural selection, could shape morphological evolution during the invasion. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses reveal seven distinct native-range source populations for 10 introduced A. sagrei populations from Florida, Louisiana and Texas (USA), and Grand Cayman, with 2-5 native-range sources contributing to each non-native population. These introduced populations differ significantly in frequencies of haplotypes from different native-range sources and in body size, toepad-lamella number, and body shape. Variation among introduced populations for both lamella number and body shape is explained by differential admixture of various source populations; mean morphological values of introduced populations are correlated with the relative genetic contributions from different native-range source populations. The number of source populations contributing to an introduced population correlates with body size, which appears independent of the relative contributions of particular source populations. Thus, differential admixture of various native-range source populations explains morphological differences among introduced A. sagrei populations. Morphological differentiation among populations is compatible with the hypothesis of selective neutrality, although we are unable to test the hypothesis of interdemic selection among introductions from different native-range source populations.},

@article{Shedlock:2006aa,
	Abstract = {It is unlikely that taxonomically diverse phylogenetic studies will be completed rapidly in the near future for nonmodel organisms on a whole-genome basis. However, one approach to advancing the field of "phylogenomics" is to estimate the structure of poorly known genomes by mining libraries of clones from suites of taxa, rather than from single species. The present analysis adopts this approach by taking advantage of megabase-scale end-sequence scanning of reptilian genomic clones to characterize diversity of CR1-like LINEs, the dominant family of transposable elements (TEs) in the sister group of mammals. As such, it helps close an important gap in the literature on the molecular systematics and evolution of retroelements in nonavian reptiles. Results from aligning more than 14 Mb of sequence from the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), painted turtle (Chrysemys picta), Bahamian green anole (Anolis smaragdinus), Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), and Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata) against a comprehensive library approximately 3000 TE-encoding peptides reflect an increasing abundance of LINE and non-long-terminal-repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposon repeat types with the age of common ancestry among exemplar reptilian clades. The hypothesis that repeat diversity is correlated with basal metabolic rate was tested using comparative methods and a significant nonlinear relationship was indicated. This analysis suggests that the age of divergence between an exemplary clade and its sister group as well as metabolic correlates should be considered in addition to genome size in explaining patterns of retroelement diversity. The first phylogenetic analysis of the largely unexplored chicken repeat 1 (CR1) 3' reverse transcriptase (RT) conserved domains 8 and 9 in nonavian reptiles reveals a pattern of multiple lineages with variable branch lengths, suggesting presence of both old and young elements and the existence of several distinct well-supported clades not apparent from previous characterization of CR1 subfamily structure in birds and the turtle. This mode of CR1 evolution contrasts with historical patterns of LINE 1 diversification in mammals and hints toward the existence of a rich but still largely unexplored diversity of nonavian retroelements of importance to advancing both comparative vertebrate genomics and amniote systematics.},

@article{Nicholson:2007aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dewlaps of Anolis lizards provide a classic example of a complex signaling system whose function and evolution is poorly understood. Dewlaps are flaps of skin beneath the chin that are extended and combined with head and body movements for visual signals and displays. They exhibit extensive morphological variation and are one of two cladistic features uniting anoles, yet little is known regarding their function and evolution. We quantified the diversity of anole dewlaps, investigated whether dewlap morphology was informative regarding phylogenetic relationships, and tested two separate hypotheses: (A) similar Anolis habitat specialists possess similar dewlap configurations (Ecomorph Convergence hypothesis), and (B) sympatric species differ in their dewlap morphologies to a greater extent than expected by chance (Species Recognition hypothesis). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that dewlap configurations (sizes, patterns and colors) exhibit substantial diversity, but that most are easily categorized into six patterns that incorporate one to three of 13 recognizable colors. Dewlap morphology is not phylogenetically informative and, like other features of anoles, exhibits convergence in configurations. We found no support for the Ecomorph Convergence hypothesis; species using the same structural habitat were no more similar in dewlap configuration than expected by chance. With one exception, all sympatric species in four communities differ in dewlap configuration. However, this provides only weak support for the Species Recognition hypothesis because, due to the great diversity in dewlap configurations observed across each island, few cases of sympatric species with identical dewlaps would be expected to co-occur by chance alone. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite previous thought, most dewlaps exhibit easily characterizable patterns and colorations. Nevertheless, dewlap variation is extensive and explanations for the origin and evolution of this diversity are lacking. Our data do not support two hypothesized explanations for this diversity, but others such as sexual selection remain to be tested.},

	Abstract = {We report results of a megabase-scale phylogenomic analysis of the Reptilia, the sister group of mammals. Large-scale end-sequence scanning of genomic clones of a turtle, alligator, and lizard reveals diverse, mammal-like landscapes of retroelements and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) not found in the chicken. Several global genomic traits, including distinctive phylogenetic lineages of CR1-like long interspersed elements (LINEs) and a paucity of A-T rich SSRs, characterize turtles and archosaur genomes, whereas higher frequencies of tandem repeats and a lower global GC content reveal mammal-like features in Anolis. Nonavian reptile genomes also possess a high frequency of diverse and novel 50-bp unit tandem duplications not found in chicken or mammals. The frequency distributions of approximately 65,000 8-mer oligonucleotides suggest that rates of DNA-word frequency change are an order of magnitude slower in reptiles than in mammals. These results suggest a diverse array of interspersed and SSRs in the common ancestor of amniotes and a genomic conservatism and gradual loss of retroelements in reptiles that culminated in the minimalist chicken genome. The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in the GenBank database (accession nos. CZ 250707-CZ 257443 and DX 390731-DX 389174).},

	Abstract = {This is an expanded study of the relationships among the deuterostome animals based on combined, nearly complete 28S and 18S rRNA genes (>3925 nt.). It adds sequences from 20 more taxa to the approximately 45 sequences used in past studies. Seven of the new taxa were sequenced here (brittle star Ophiomyxa, lizard Anolis, turtle Chrysemys, sixgill shark Hexanchus, electric ray Narcine, Southern Hemisphere lamprey Geotria, and Atlantic hagfish Myxine for 28S), and the other 13 were from GenBank and the literature (from a chicken, dog, rat, human, three lungfishes, and several ray-finned fishes, or Actinopterygii). As before, our alignments were based on secondary structure but did not account for base pairing in the stems of rRNA. The new findings, derived from likelihood-based tree-reconstruction methods and by testing hypotheses with parametric bootstrapping, include: (1) brittle star joins with sea star in the echinoderm clade, Asterozoa; (2) with two hagfishes and two lampreys now available, the cyclostome (jawless) fishes remain monophyletic; (3) Hexanchiform sharks are monophyletic, as Hexanchus groups with the frilled shark, Chlamydoselachus; (4) turtle is the sister taxon of all other amniotes; (5) bird is closer to the lizard than to the mammals; (6) the bichir Polypterus is in a monophyletic Actinopterygii; (7) Zebrafish Danio is the sister taxon of the other two teleosts we examined (trout and perch); (8) the South American and African lungfishes group together to the exclusion of the Australian lungfish. Other findings either upheld those of the previous rRNA-based studies (e.g., echinoderms and hemichordates group as Ambulacraria; orbitostylic sharks; batoids are not derived from any living lineage of sharks) or were obvious (monophyly of mammals, gnathostomes, vertebrates, echinoderms, etc.). Despite all these findings, the rRNA data still fail to resolve the relations among the major groups of deuterostomes (tunicates, Ambulacraria, cephalochordates and vertebrates) and of gnathostomes (chondrichthyans, lungfishes, coelacanth, actinopterygians, amphibians, and amniotes), partly because tunicates and lungfishes are rogue taxa that disrupt the tree. Nonetheless, parametric bootstrapping showed our RNA-gene data are only consistent with these dominant hypotheses: (1) deuterostomes consist of Ambulacraria plus Chordata, with Chordata consisting of tunicates and 'vertebrates plus cephalochordates'; and (2) lungfishes are the closest living relatives of tetrapods.},

@article{Ord:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Extensive research over the last few decades has revealed that many acoustically communicating animals compensate for the masking effect of background noise by changing the structure of their signals. Familiar examples include birds using acoustic properties that enhance the transmission of vocalizations in noisy habitats. Here, we show that the effects of background noise on communication signals are not limited to the acoustic modality, and that visual noise from windblown vegetation has an equally important influence on the production of dynamic visual displays. We found that two species of Puerto Rican lizard, Anolis cristatellus and A. gundlachi, increase the speed of body movements used in territorial signalling to apparently improve communication in visually 'noisy' environments of rapidly moving vegetation. This is the first evidence that animals change how they produce dynamic visual signals when communicating in noisy motion habitats. Taken together with previous work on acoustic communication, our results show that animals with very different sensory ecologies can face similar environmental constraints and adopt remarkably similar strategies to overcome these constraints.},

@article{Watt:2007aa,
	Abstract = {At the onset of agonistic social challenge, individuals must assess the degree of threat the opponent represents in order to react appropriately. We aimed to characterize the neuroendocrine changes accompanying this period of initial social assessment using the lizard Anolis carolinensis. Conveyance of aggressive intent by male A. carolinensis is facilitated by rapid postorbital skin darkening (eyespot), whereas eyespot presence inhibits opponent aggression. By manipulating this visual signal, we also investigated whether differing neuroendocrine changes were evoked by initial presentation of varying levels of social threat. Subjects were painted postorbitally either with black paint (high threat level), green paint (low threat level) or water (controls). Painted animals were presented with a mirror and sampled immediately upon exhibiting aggressive intent towards the reflected simulated opponent, but before producing behaviors such as motor pattern-based displays. Control animals (blank surface presented) were sampled at times derived from averaging response times of painted subjects. Brains and plasma were analyzed for monoamine activity and catecholamine levels using electrochemical HPLC. Social threat evoked increases in plasma catecholamine levels indistinguishable from those caused by brief environmental disturbance. However, brief social challenge caused distinct rapid increases in amygdala and nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine and serotonin levels. Amygdalar changes were associated with general social threat presence, but NAc monoamines were affected by both threat level and subject motivation to engage in confrontation. This suggests that specific rapid activity changes in key forebrain limbic nuclei differ according to the degree of social threat perceived at the start of the interaction.},

	Abstract = {Reactions to stress vary between individuals, and physiological and behavioral responses tend to be associated in distinct suites of correlated traits, often termed stress-coping styles. In mammals, individuals exhibiting divergent stress-coping styles also appear to exhibit intrinsic differences in cognitive processing. A connection between physiology, behavior, and cognition was also recently demonstrated in strains of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) selected for consistently high or low cortisol responses to stress. The low-responsive (LR) strain display longer retention of a conditioned response, and tend to show proactive behaviors such as enhanced aggression, social dominance, and rapid resumption of feed intake after stress. Differences in brain monoamine neurochemistry have also been reported in these lines. In comparative studies, experiments with the lizard Anolis carolinensis reveal connections between monoaminergic activity in limbic structures, proactive behavior in novel environments, and the establishment of social status via agonistic behavior. Together these observations suggest that within-species diversity of physiological, behavioral and cognitive correlates of stress responsiveness is maintained by natural selection throughout the vertebrate sub-phylum.},

	Abstract = {Interactions among reproductive season, testosterone (T) and female presence were investigated on the structure and function of forebrain and neuromuscular systems controlling courtship and copulation in the green anole lizard. Under breeding (BS) or non-breeding (NBS) environmental conditions, male green anoles were implanted with either T or blank capsules and exposed to one of three female stimulus conditions: physical, visual or no female contact. T and at least visual exposure to females increased courtship displays (extension of a throat fan, or dewlap), and these effects were greater during the BS than NBS. T also facilitated copulation, and did so to a greater extent in the BS. The hormone increased soma size in the preoptic area (POA) and amygdala (AMY), and in the AMY the effects were greater in the BS than NBS. Cross-sectional areas of copulatory organs and associated muscle fibers were enhanced by T, and more so in the BS than NBS. However, no effects on morphology of dewlap motoneurons or muscles or copulatory motoneurons were detected. Thus, (1) changes in behavior and neural and/or muscular morphology are not always parallel and (2) differences in responsiveness to T exist across seasons and among tissues.},

	Abstract = {Caribbean Anolis lizards are often cited as a textbook example of adaptive radiation. Similar morphologies (ecomorphs) have originated in similar ecological settings on different large islands in the West Indies. However, relatively little is known about one of the morphologically most specialized and divergent ecomorphs: the twig anoles. Here, we investigate aspects of morphology, dewlap size, locomotor and bite performance, structural habitat and diet of the poorly known twig anole, Anolis sheplani from Hispaniola. Few observations have previously been made of this species in its natural habitat, and few quantitative data on its natural history are available. A. sheplani is an extreme twig anole with respect to its morphology, performance capacities, and ecological niche. Males and females of this species do not differ from each other in body dimensions, performance or habitat use, but males do have a bigger dewlap than females. We present data for 25 individuals and compare them with data for other Greater Antillean anoles. It becomes apparent that twig anoles constitute a large component of the morphological, functional, and ecological diversity of Anolis lizards. Small twig anoles such as A. sheplani appear to be pushing the boundaries of morphospace and are thus crucial in our understanding of the evolution of phenotypic diversity.},

	Abstract = {Although of prime ecological relevance, acceleration capacity is a poorly understood locomotor performance trait in terrestrial vertebrates. No empirical data exist on which design characteristics determine acceleration capacity among species and whether these design traits influence other aspects of locomotor performance. In this study we explore how acceleration capacity and sprint speed have evolved in Anolis lizards. We investigate whether the same or different morphological traits (i.e., limb dimensions and muscle mass) correlate with both locomotor traits. Within our sample of Anolis lizards, relative sprint speed and acceleration capacity coevolved. However, whereas the variation in relative acceleration capacity is primarily explained by the variation in relative knee extensor muscle mass, the variation in relative sprint speed is correlated to the variation in relative femur, tibia, and metatarsus length as well as knee extensor muscle mass. The fact that the design features required to excel in either performance trait partly overlap might explain the positive correlation between the variation in relative sprint speed and acceleration capacity. Furthermore, our data show how similar levels of sprint performance can be achieved through different morphological traits (limb segment lengths and muscle mass) suggesting that redundant mapping has potentially played a role in mitigating trade-offs.},

	Abstract = {We investigated how substrate diameter affects acceleration performance in three Anolis lizard species (A. sagrei, A. carolinensis and A. valencienni), representing three different ecomorphs (trunk-ground, trunk-crown, and twig, respectively). We did so by measuring maximal acceleration capacity of the three species on a broad and narrow dowel. In addition to acceleration capacity, we quantified maximal sprint speed on both dowels. Both acceleration capacity and sprint speed are affected by substrate diameter, but the way in which they are, differs among species. Acceleration capacity in the trunk-ground anole, A. sagrei, was least affected by dowel diameter, whereas it was greatly reduced on the narrow dowel in the twig anole, A. valencienni. Sprint speed on the narrow dowel, however, was reduced to the greatest extent in the fastest running species, A. sagrei, whereas sprint speed was hardly affected by dowel diameter in the slow A. valencienni. The differential effect of dowel diameter on maximal acceleration capacity cannot be explained by differences in the timing of reaching maximal acceleration, but may be due to interspecific differences in the relative positioning of the limbs on the different dowels. The differential effect of dowel diameter on sprint speed, on the other hand, may be based on interspecific differences in the relative contribution of subsequent acceleratory bouts to maximal sprint speed on the broad and narrow dowel.},

	Abstract = {Animals can acquire bright coloration using a variety of pigmentary and microstructural mechanisms. Reptiles and amphibians are known to use two types of pigments - pterins and carotenoids - to generate their spectrum of colorful red, orange, and yellow hues. Because both pigment classes can confer all of these hues, the relative importance of pterins versus carotenoids in creating these different colors is not always apparent. We studied the carotenoid and pterin content of red and yellow dewlap regions in two neotropical anole species - the brown anole (Norops sagrei) and the ground anole (N. humilis). Pterins (likely drosopterins) and carotenoids (likely xanthophylls) were present in all tissues from all individuals. Pterins were more enriched in the lateral (red) region, and carotenoids more enriched in the midline (yellow) region in N. humilis, but pterins and carotenoids were found in similar concentrations among lateral and midline regions in N. sagrei. These patterns indicate that both carotenoid and pterin pigments are responsible for producing color in the dichromatic dewlaps of these two species, and that in these two species the two pigments interact differently to produce the observed colors.},

	Abstract = {Uteri of Anolis carolinensis exhibited spontaneous rhythmic contractions in vitro. Addition of arginine vasotocin (AVT) caused an immediate, strong, tonic contraction followed by rhythmic contractions with the same frequency as spontaneous contractions but of a greater amplitude. At low tension (1.5 g) the AVT-induced tonic contraction was blocked by low dose of indomethacin, suggesting that it is influenced by calcium rather than prostaglandins (PGs). An increase in tension (from 1.5 to 15 g) reduced the duration of the AVT-induced tonic contraction; this stretch-induced decrease was also blocked by indomethacin. Stretch also decreased the duration of the rhythmic contractions, but this stretch effect was not inhibited by indomethacin. The rest interval between rhythmic contractions was decreased by PGF2alpha and PGE2, and indomethacin or stretch blocked these PG effects. Indomethacin, AVT, or stretch alone did not affect PGF2alpha secretion from AVT-treated uteri. Stretch also reduced PGF2alpha secretion from AVT-treated uteri, an effect inhibited by indomethacin.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the evolution of complex functional traits is a challenge for evolutionary physiology. Here we investigate the evolution of subdigital toepads in lizards, which have arisen independently at least three times, although with subtle anatomical differences. Some designs (anole, gecko) appear functionally equivalent, whereas other designs (skink) are inferior. The functional equivalence of geckos and anoles highlights the creative aspect of the evolutionary process in that these two groups have arrived at the same functional endpoint along very different trajectories. However, this functional equivalence does not result in equivalence for performance at whole-organism tasks (e.g., running uphill), as the evolution of behavior (e.g., toe-furling) has enabled geckos to be superior climbers than anoles. We also show that adaptive increases in the toepad size within a closely related lizard genus (Anolis) has resulted in concomitant evolution of enhanced clinging ability and increased perch heights. A third insight is that pad-bearing geckos are capable of carrying tremendous loads (up to 250% of body weight) up smooth surfaces, and that the toepad itself does not appear limiting. This comparative and whole-organism approach to lizard toepads underscores how organisms can evolve multiple solutions to evolutionary problems.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in ecological niche modeling (ENM) algorithms, in conjunction with increasing availability of geographic information system (GIS) data, allow species' niches to be predicted over broad geographic areas using environmental characteristics associated with point localities for a given species. Consequently, the examination of how niches evolve is now possible using a regionally inclusive multivariate approach to characterize the environmental requirements of a species. Initial work that uses this approach has suggested that niche evolution is characterized by conservatism: the more closely related species are, the more similar are their niches. We applied a phylogenetic approach to examine niche evolution during the radiation of Cuban trunk-ground anoles (Anolis sagrei group), which has produced 15 species in Cuba. We modeled the niche of 11 species within this group using the WhyWhere ENM algorithm and examined the evolution of the niche using a phylogeny based on approximately 1500 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA. No general relationship exists between phylogenetic similarity and niche similarity. Examination of species pairs indicates some examples in which closely related species display niche conservatism and some in which they exhibit highly divergent niches. In addition, some distantly related species exhibit significant niche similarity. Comparisons also revealed a specialist-generalist sister species pair in which the niche of one species is nested within, and much narrower than, the niche of another closely related species.},

@article{Queiroz:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Geographical distributions of terrestrial or freshwater taxa that are broken up by oceans can be explained by either oceanic dispersal or vicariance in the form of fragmentation of a previously contiguous landmass. The validation of plate-tectonics theory provided a global vicariance mechanism and, along with cladistic arguments for the primacy of vicariance, helped create a view of oceanic dispersal as a rare phenomenon and an explanation of last resort. Here, I describe recent work that suggests that the importance of oceanic dispersal has been strongly underestimated. In particular, molecular dating of lineage divergences favors oceanic dispersal over tectonic vicariance as an explanation for disjunct distributions in a wide variety of taxa, from frogs to beetles to baobab trees. Other evidence, such as substantial gene flow among island populations of Anolis lizards, also indicates unexpectedly high frequencies of oceanic dispersal. The resurrection of oceanic dispersal is the most striking aspect of a major shift in historical biogeography toward a more even balance between vicariance and dispersal explanations. This new view implies that biotas are more dynamic and have more recent origins than had been thought previously. A high frequency of dispersal also suggests that a fundamental methodological assumption of many biogeographical studies--that vicariance is a priori a more probable explanation than dispersal--needs to be re-evaluated and perhaps discarded.},

	Abstract = {Examples of convergent evolution suggest that natural selection can often produce predictable evolutionary outcomes. However, unique histories among species can lead to divergent evolution regardless of their shared selective pressures-and some contend that such historical contingencies produce the dominant features of evolution. A classic example of convergent evolution is the set of Anolis lizard ecomorphs of the Greater Antilles. On each of four islands, anole species partition the structural habitat into at least four categories, exhibiting similar morphologies within each category. We assessed the relative importance of shared selection due to habitat similarity, unique island histories, and unique effects of similar habitats on different islands in the generation of morphological variation in anole ecomorphs. We found that shared features of diversification across habitats were of greatest importance, but island effects on morphology (reflecting either island effects per se or phylogenetic relationships) and unique aspects of habitat diversification on different islands were also important. There were three distinct cases of island-specific habitat diversification, and only one was confounded by phylogenetic relatedness. The other two unique aspects were not related to shared ancestry but might reflect as-yet-unmeasured environmental differences between islands in habitat characteristics. Quantifying the relative importance of shared and unique responses to similar selective regimes provides a more complete understanding of phenotypic diversification, even in this much-studied system.},

A verification study, using a single-tube nested PCR to eliminate contamination, showed that infections as low as 1 parasite per millions of erythrocytes could be detected by amplifying a 673 bp fragment of the cytochrome b gene. Very low-level parasitemia infections, subpatent under the microscope, were common in A. sabanus on Saba sites, with no significant seasonal difference (31% of infections appearing uninfected by microscopic examination in summer were found infected by PCR, 38% in winter). At the Puerto Rico site, the subpatent infections were also common in A. gundlachi, but were more prevalent in winter (53%) than in summer (17%). A similar high frequency of subpatent infections is known from studies on human and bird malaria, but a previous PCR-based study on a temperate lizard malaria system found few such low-level infections. Differences in the prevalence of subpatent infections by site and season suggest transmission biology may select for distinct life history strategies by the parasite.},

	Abstract = {Anoles of the Anolis onca series represent a dramatic case of retrograde evolution, exhibiting great reduction (A. annectens) and loss (A. onca) of the subdigital pads considered a key innovation for the evolutionary radiation of anoles in arboreal environments. We present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of these anoles and their closest known relatives (A. auratus, A. lineatus, A. meridionalis, and A. nitens) using new mitochondrial DNA sequence data from the ND2 gene, five tRNA genes (tRNA(Trp), tRNA(Ala), tRNA(Asn), tRNA(Cys), tRNA(Tyr)), the origin of light-strand replication, and a portion of the CO1 gene (1,446 aligned base positions, 612 parsimony informative). Our results confirm monophyly of the A. onca series and suggest an evolutionary separation of approximately 10 million years between A. annectens and A. onca. Evolution of subdigital structure in this series illustrates ectopic expression of developmental programs that replace flexible subdigital lamellae of the toepad with rigid, keeled scales resembling dorsal digital scales. Our phylogenetic results indicate that narrowing of the toepad in A. auratus evolved separately from toepad reduction in the A. onca series. Expansion of the subdigital lamellae along the phalanges in A. auratus appears to compensate constriction of lamellae by digital narrowing, maintaining greater climbing capability in this species. Toepad evolution in the lineage ancestral to A. auratus features changes of the same developmental modules as the A. onca series but in the opposite direction. Large molecular distances between geographic populations of A. auratus indicate that its derived toepad structure is at least 9 million years old.},

The authors report that artificially hiding or darkening eyespots influences central dopaminergic activity, social status, and aggression during dyadic social interaction. All males that viewed an opponent with eyespots painted black became subordinate and exhibited elevated dopamine in raphe, lateral amygdala, and medial amygdala but decreased dopamine in septum and locus ceruleus.

	Abstract = {We monitored spiders on 41 Bahamian islands for 4 years before and then 4 years after the catastrophic Hurricane Floyd passed directly over the site, inundating the study islands with its storm surge. The respective recoveries of major community properties after this annihilation were far from synchronous. Before the hurricane, the species-area relation was generally strong and the slope showed no temporal trend. After the hurricane, the slope increased from near zero (7 months later) to a value about equal to its prehurricane state. The lizard effect (difference in spider abundance or species richness between islands with and without the lizard Anolis sagrei) was generally strong before the hurricane; 7 months after, the lizard effect on abundance was weak and the effect on richness had vanished. In subsequent years, the lizard effect on abundance became strong again, but the effect on species richness remained weak. The strength of the lizard effect on both abundance and richness over the 8 years was strongly positively related to the density of lizards measured on a subset of the study islands. Twelve months after the hurricane, species richness averaged over all islands rebounded to the last prehurricane value, but abundance attained only about half that value; this finding was remarkably similar to results found in an earlier study of spiders impacted by Hurricane Lili (1996) in a different Bahamian region. Nonetheless, in the next 3 years, species richness failed to increase further, part of its long-term decline at the study site.},

	Abstract = {Metabolic rates of reptiles vary with body temperature; therefore, the sensitivity of reptiles to a particular dose level of a pesticide might be expected to vary as well. The purpose of the present study was twofold: To evaluate the effects of temperature on the toxicity to green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) of a single concentration of a natural pyrethrin pesticide via percutaneous exposure, and to compare the effects of temperature (20 vs 35 degrees C) on the toxicity of different concentrations of pyrethrins to green anoles. When lizards were exposed to a solution that contained 300 mg/L of pyrethrins, the mortality of lizards maintained at 15 and 20 degrees C was significantly higher (p < 0.01) than the mortality of lizards maintained at 35 and 38 degrees C. In addition, the median lethal concentrations of pyrethrins for lizards maintained at 20 and 35 degrees C were 77.6 and greater than 300 mg/L, respectively. Therefore, temperature clearly influenced the sensitivity of lizards to pyrethrin pesticides.},

@article{Irschick:2006ab,
	Abstract = {Age-specific forced polymorphism is the presence of two or more distinct phenotypes (here we consider only males) that occur in separate sexually mature age groups (e.g., horns in older males but not younger males). The life-stage morph maturation hypothesis posits that all younger males that possess a particular structure can transform into older males with a different structure, most likely via the influence of hormones. The life-stage morph selection hypothesis posits that polymorphism is due to intense selection resulting in a highly nonrandom sample of younger males surviving to become older males, thus leading to different mean phenotypes in different age groups. We conducted an extensive review of literature from the past 20 years (1983-2003) for cases of age-specific forced polymorphism. Overall, we found only a few cases that fit our criteria of age-specific forced polymorphism, and we argue that most (e.g., orangutans, elephant seals) have likely arisen via the life-stage morph maturation mechanism, but we also present several examples (e.g., green anole lizards) that appear to be candidates for life-stage morph selection. However, none of the reviewed studies provided enough information (e.g., age of morphs, growth patterns of the morphological structure) to definitively invoke either of the two mechanisms. We suggest that age-specific forced polymorphism is more common than reflected in this review and that future studies should gather demographic and laboratory data that will directly compare the life-stage morph maturation and life-stage morph selection hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {Population phenomena, which provide much of the underlying basis for the theoretical structure of island biogeography, have received little direct study. We determined a key population trait-survival-in the Bahamian lizard Anolis sagrei on islands with an experimentally introduced predatory lizard and on neighboring unmanipulated islands. On unmanipulated islands, survival declined with several variables, most notably vegetation height: The island with the shortest vegetation had nearly the highest survival recorded for any lizard. On islands with the introduced predator, which forages mostly on the ground, A. sagrei shifted to taller vegetation; unlike on unmanipulated islands, its survival was very low on islands with the shortest vegetation but was higher on the others. Thus, species introduction radically changed a resident species' relation of survival to a key island-biogeographical variable.},

	Abstract = {The reconstruction of phylogeny requires homologous similarities across species. Characters that have been shown to evolve quickly or convergently in some species are often considered to be poor phylogenetic markers. Here I evaluate the phylogenetic utility of a set of morphological characters that are correlated with ecology and have been shown to evolve convergently in Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles. Results of randomization tests suggest that these "ecomorph" characters are adequate phylogenetic markers, both for Anolis in general and for the Greater Antillean species for which ecomorphological convergence was originally documented. Explanations for this result include the presence of ecomorphologically similar species within evolutionary radiations within islands, some monophyly of ecomorphs across islands, and the existence of several species that defy ecomorphological characterization but share phylogenetic similarity in some ecomorph characters.},

	Abstract = {In the present study, we exposed 53 animals from 23 different species of amphibians and reptiles to microgravity (mug). This nearly doubles the number of amphibians and reptiles observed so far in mug. The animals were flown on a parabolic flight, which provided 20-25s of mug, to better characterize behavioral reactions to abrupt exposure to mug. Highly fossorial limbless caecilians and amphisbaenians showed relatively limited movement in mug. Limbed quadrupedal reptiles that were non-arboreal in the genera Leiocephalus, Anolis, and Scincella showed the typical righting response and enormous amounts of body motion and tail rotation, which we interpreted as both righting responses and futile actions to grasp the substrate. Both arboreal and non-arboreal geckos in the genera Uroplatus, Palmatogecko, Stenodactylus, Tarentola, and Eublepharis instead showed a skydiving posture previously reported for highly arboreal anurans. Some snakes, in the genera Thamnophis and Elaphe, which typically thrashed and rolled in mug, managed to knot their own bodies with their tails and immediately became quiescent. This suggests that these reptiles gave stable physical contact, which would indicate that they were not falling, primacy over vestibular input that indicated that they were in freefall. The fact that they became quiet upon self-embrace further suggests a failure to distinguish self from non-self. The patterns of behavior seen in amphibians and reptiles in mug can be explained in light of their normal ecology and taxonomic relations.},

@article{Summers:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Socially aggressive interaction is stressful, and as such, glucocorticoids are typically secreted during aggressive interaction in a variety of vertebrates, which may both potentiate and inhibit aggression. The behavioral relationship between corticosterone and/or cortisol in non-mammalian (as well as mammalian) vertebrates is dependent on timing, magnitude, context, and coordination of physiological and behavioral responses. Chronically elevated plasma glucocorticoids reliably inhibit aggressive behavior, consistent with an evolutionarily adaptive behavioral strategy among subordinate and submissive individuals. Acute elevation of plasma glucocorticoids may either promote an actively aggressive response via action in specialized local regions of the brain such as the anterior hypothalamus, or is permissive to escalated aggression and/or activity. Although the permissive effect of glucocorticoids on aggression does not suggest an active role for the hormone, the corticosteroids may be necessary for full expression of aggressive behavior, as in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. These effects suggest that short-term stress may generally be best counteracted by an actively aggressive response, at least for socially dominant proactive individuals. An acute and active response may be evolutionarily maladaptive under chronic, uncontrollable and unpredictable circumstances. It appears that subordinate reactive individuals often produce compulsorily chronic responses that inhibit aggression and promote submissive behavior.},

Topical application of the two compounds led to the quick disappearance of nematodes and cestodes from a broad spectrum of hosts including mice, jirds, snakes, anole lizards, turtles, monitor lizards, etc. In reptiles the dosage had to be increased, since the thick outer layer of the epidermis hinders the penetration of the compounds. In animals with an extremely thick epidermis (e.g. monitor lizards, leguans) the new product was applied under the armpits.},

@article{Irschick:2005aa,
	Abstract = {A key assumption in evolutionary studies of locomotor adaptation is that standard laboratory measures of performance accurately reflect what animals do under natural circumstances. One widely examined measure of performance is maximum sprint speed, which is believed to be important for eluding predators, capturing prey, and defending territories. Previous studies linking maximum sprint speed to fitness have focused on laboratory measurements, and we suggest that such analyses may be appropriate for some species and intraspecific classes, but not others. We provide evidence for a general inverse relationship between maximum laboratory sprint speed and the percentage of maximum capacity that animals use when escaping from a threat in the field (the model of locomotor compensation). Further, absolute values of field escape speed and maximum laboratory speed are not significantly related when comparing across a diverse group of Anolis and lacertid lizards. We show that this pattern of locomotor compensation holds both within (i.e., among intraspecific classes) and among lizard species (with some exceptions). We propose a simple method of plotting field escape speed (y-axis) versus maximum laboratory speed (x-axis) among species and/or intraspecific classes that allows researchers to determine whether their study organisms are good candidates for relating laboratory performance to fitness. We suggest that species that reside directly on, or near the "best fitness line" (field escape speed = maximum laboratory speed) are most likely to bear fruit for such studies.},

	Abstract = {Immobilization stress and physical activity separately influence monoaminergic function. In addition, it appears that stress and locomotion reciprocally modulate neuroendocrine responses, with forced exercise ameliorating stress-induced serotonergic activity in lizards. To investigate the interaction of forced physical activity and restraint stress on central dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (Epi), we measured these catecholamines and their metabolites in select brain regions of stressed and exercised male Anolis carolinensis lizards. Animals were handled briefly to elicit restraint stress, with some lizards additionally forced to run on a track until exhaustion, or half that time (50% of average time to exhaustion), compared to a control group that experienced no restraint or exercise. Norepinephrine concentrations in the hippocampus and locus ceruleus decreased with restraint stress, but returned to control levels following forced exhaustion. Levels of NE in the raphe nuclei and area postrema, and epinephrine in raphe became elevated following restraint stress, and returned to control levels following forced physical activity to 50% or 100% exhaustion. Striatal DA increased as animals were exercised to 50% of exhaustion, and returned to baseline with exhaustion. At exhaustion, striatal Epi levels were diminished, compared with controls. In the area postrema, exhaustion reversed a decline in epinephrine levels that followed forced physical activity. These results suggest that stress stimulates a rapid influence on central catecholamines. In addition, forced exercise, and even exhaustion, may alleviate the effects of restraint stress on central monoamines.},

@article{Lazzari:2005aa,
	Abstract = {We analyzed the distribution of intermediate filament molecular markers, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and vimentin in the brain and spinal cord of the adult brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei. The GFAP immunoreactivity is strong and the positive structures are basically represented by fibers of different lengths and thicknesses which are arranged in a regular radial pattern throughout the central nervous system. In the brain regions that have a thicker neural wall, the radial orientation is not so evident as in the thinner areas. These fibers emerge from radial ependymoglia (tanycytes) whose cell bodies are generally GFAP-immunopositive. The glial fibers give rise to endfeet that are apposed to the subpial surface and to blood vessel walls. In the spinal cord, the optic tectum and the lateroventral regions of the mesencephalon and medulla oblongata, star-shaped astrocytes coexist with radial structures. Vimentin-immunoreactive structures are absent in the brain and spinal cord. In A. sagrei the immunohistochemical response of the astroglial intermediate filaments appears typical of a mature astroglial cell lineage, since they fundamentally express GFAP immunoreactivity. A Western-blot analysis reveals a GFAP-positive single band, common to the different nervous areas. This immunohistochemical study shows that the star-shaped astrocytes have a different distribution in saurians and while the glial pattern of A. sagrei is more evolved than in urodeles it remains immature as compared with crocodilians, avians, and mammals. This condition suggests that reptiles represent a fundamental step in the phylogenetic evolution of the vertebrate glial cells.},

@article{Toro:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Whereas maximal performance is subjected to specific control criteria, sub-maximal movements theoretically allow for an infinite number of control strategies. Yet sub-maximal movements are predominant in the locomotor repertoire of most organisms and often little understood. Previous data on sub-maximal vertical jumping in humans has suggested that a movement effectiveness criterion might best explain the observed control strategy employed. Here we test the generality of this criterion in jumping by inducing lizards to jump both at a range of distances as well as a range of take-off angles. Our results show that while movement effectiveness appears to best explain jumping for different take-off angles, a 'push harder' strategy (i.e. mostly increasing the force output of the system), is used in the control of distance jumping. Thus, our data support the generality of the movement effectiveness criterion for vertical jumping, but not for distance jumping. Sub-maximal distance jumping in the lizard Anolis valencienni appears to be governed by a relatively simple control strategy that allows a rapid response. This accords well to the ecological circumstances in which long jumps are typically used (escape from predators).},

@article{Summers:2005ab,
	Abstract = {Serotonin is widely believed to exert inhibitory control over aggressive behavior and intent. In addition, a number of studies of fish, reptiles, and mammals, including the lizard Anolis carolinensis, have demonstrated that serotonergic activity is stimulated by aggressive social interaction in both dominant and subordinate males. As serotonergic activity does not appear to inhibit agonistic behavior during combative social interaction, we investigated the possibility that the negative correlation between serotonergic activity and aggression exists before aggressive behavior begins. To do this, putatively dominant and more aggressive males were determined by their speed overcoming stress (latency to feeding after capture) and their celerity to court females. Serotonergic activities before aggression are differentiated by social rank in a region-specific manner. Among aggressive males baseline serotonergic activity is lower in the septum, nucleus accumbens, striatum, medial amygdala, anterior hypothalamus, raphe, and locus ceruleus but not in the hippocampus, lateral amygdala, preoptic area, substantia nigra, or ventral tegmental area. However, in regions such as the nucleus accumbens, where low serotonergic activity may help promote aggression, agonistic behavior also stimulates the greatest rise in serotonergic activity among the most aggressive males, most likely as a result of the stress associated with social interaction.},

	Abstract = {The copulatory neuromuscular system of green anoles is sexually dimorphic and differentiates during embryonic development, although details of the process were unknown. In Experiment 1, we determined the time course of normal ontogeny. Both male and female embryos possessed bilateral copulatory organs (hemipenes) and associated muscles until incubation day 13; the structures completely regressed in female embryos by incubation day 19 (total incubation 34 days). In Experiment 2, we treated eggs with testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, or vehicle on both incubation days 10 and 13 to determine whether these steroid hormones mediate sexual differentiation. These time points fall between gonadal differentiation, which was determined in Experiment 1 to complete before day 10, and regression of the peripheral copulatory system in females. Tissue was collected on the day of hatching. Gonads were classified as testes or ovaries; presence versus absence of hemipenes and muscles, and the number and size of copulatory motoneurons were determined. Copulatory system morphology of vehicle-treated animals matched their gonadal sex. Hemipenes and muscles were absent in estradiol-treated animals, and androgens rescued the hemipenes and muscles in most females. Both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone treatment also caused hypertrophy of the hemipenes, which were everted in animals treated with these steroids. Copulatory motoneurons, assessed on the day of hatching in both experiments, were not dimorphic in size or number. Steroid treatment significantly increased motoneuron size and number overall, but no significant differences were detected in pairwise comparisons. These data demonstrate that differentiation of peripheral copulatory neuromuscular structures occurs during embryonic development and is influenced by gonadal steroids (regression by estradiol and enhancement by androgens), but associated motoneurons do not differentiate until later in life.},

@article{Glor:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Overwater dispersal and subsequent allopatric speciation contribute importantly to the species diversity of West Indian Anolis lizards and many other island radiations. Here we use molecular phylogenetic analyses to assess the contribution of overwater dispersal to diversification of the Anolis carolinensis subgroup, a clade comprising nine canopy-dwelling species distributed across the northern Caribbean. Although this clade includes some of the most successful dispersers and colonists in the anole radiation, the taxonomic status and origin of many endemic populations have been ambiguous. New mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences from four species occurring on small islands or island banks (Anolis brunneus, Anolis longiceps, Anolis maynardi, Anolis smaragdinus) and one species from the continental United States (A. carolinensis) are presented and analysed with homologous sequences sampled from related species on Cuba (Anolis allisoni and Anolis porcatus). Our analyses confirm that all five non-Cuban species included in our study represent distinct, independently evolving lineages that warrant continued species recognition. Moreover, our results support Ernest Williams's hypothesis that all of these species originated by overseas colonization from Cuban source populations. However, contrary to Williams's hypothesis of Pleistocene dispersal, most colonization events leading to speciation apparently occurred earlier, in the late Miocene-Pliocene. These patterns suggest that overwater dispersal among geologically distinct islands and island banks is relatively infrequent in anoles and has contributed to allopatric speciation. Finally, our results suggest that large Greater Antillean islands serve as centres of origin for regional species diversity.},

@article{Thorpe:2005aa,
	Abstract = {Even though molecular clocks vary in rate to some extent, they are widely used and very important in a range of evolutionary studies, not least in interpreting cause and colonization in phylogeography. Evolutionists may use island age and emergence to give the earliest possible date for colonization by a species and hence give the lower limit in a molecular clock calibration. The geology of the Lesser Antilles is well studied and Barbados, although composed of some ancient rocks, is thought to have emerged only about 1 million years ago (Ma). The cytochrome b mitochondrial gene is the most widely used gene in vertebrate phylogeography, and generally evolves at a rate of 1-2% per million years (Myr) for poikilothermic vertebrates. Divergence measured across almost all of this gene in the endemic anole (Anolis extremus) reveals a mean patristic distance of approximately 8.3% between this clade and its sister, together with distinct divergence and phylogeographical structure within Barbados. The divergence time, estimated by a range of procedures using four calibration points, is not in the least compatible with the proposed geological time of emergence of Barbados. Hence, either the molecular clock rate does not apply to the Barbadian anole population, or the geological dating of the emergence of Barbados is erroneous. The compatibility of geological times and molecular divergence of this complex on Martinique, together with relative rates tests comparing the rates on Barbados and Martinique, do not suggest atypical clock rates. The question of whether Barbados emerged much earlier than is currently thought, or whether the molecular clock assumptions are inappropriate, remains open.},

	Abstract = {Convergent evolution has played an important role in the development of the ecological niche concept. We investigated patterns of convergent and divergent evolution of Caribbean Anolis lizards. These lizards diversified independently on each of the islands of the Greater Antilles, producing the same set of habitat specialists on each island. Using a phylogenetic comparative framework, we examined patterns of morphological convergence in five functionally distinct sets of morphological characters: body size, body shape, head shape, lamella number, and sexual size dimorphism. We find evidence for convergence among members of the habitat specialist types for each of these five datasets. Furthermore, the patterns of convergence differ among at least four of the five datasets; habitat specialists that are similar for one set of characters are often greatly different for another. This suggests that the habitat specialist niches into which these anoles have evolved are multidimensional, involving several distinct and independent aspects of morphology.},

	Abstract = {The theory behind ecotypic differentiation and ecological speciation assumes a predominant role for natural selection working on characteristics with genetic variance, but experimental support for these assumptions is limited. Lesser Antillean anoles show marked ecotypic variation within islands and the potential for ecological speciation. Common garden rearing experiments on the Dominican anole (Anolis oculatus) suggest that the characters showing geographic variation have genetic variance and are not primarily determined by environmental plasticity. Replicated natural selection experiments using large-scale enclosures show that translocated montane samples experience significant (multivariate) directional selection in both wet and dry seasons in both males and females. The targets of selection appear to be spread among the various character systems. An experiment on 12 geographically segregated populations along a coastal xeric-montane rainforest gradient (four replicate enclosures) clearly showed that the magnitude of the directional selection intensity is positively related to the position along this gradient. The results of the common garden and natural selection experiments support the interpretation that the geographic differentiation is primarily driven by natural selection and are compatible with the potential for ecological speciation in this system.},

	Abstract = {We compared the natural ultraviolet B (UV-B) exposure, dietary vitamin D, and skin-generated vitamin D synthesis for adult males of two species of Jamaican anoles. The more shade-tolerant and thermal-conforming Anolis lineotopus merope, rarely exposed to full sun, experienced less UV-B irradiation in its shady environment than the more heliophilic and thermophilic Anolis sagrei, which frequently basked in full sun during the morning hours (0800-1100 hours). Both species obtained detectable levels of vitamin D(3) in their diet, but the heliophilic A. sagrei obtained more. To compensate for less availability of UV-B and dietary vitamin D, the skin of A. lineotopus merope seems to have acquired a greater sensitivity than that of A. sagrei regarding UV-B-induced vitamin D(3) photobiosynthesis. We assessed this by observing a greater conversion of provitamin D to photoproducts in skin exposed to UV-B from a sunlamp. The reduced skin sensitivity of A. sagrei regarding vitamin D photobiosynthesis may reflect a correlated response associated with less need for vitamin D photobiosynthesis and greater need for UV-B screening capacity as an adaptation to a more damaging UV-B environment. However, the possibility that adaptations for photobiosynthesis of vitamin D and for protection from skin damage could involve independent mechanisms needs investigation. Also, the ability to behaviorally regulate UV-B exposure, as shown for the panther chameleon, would benefit both species of Anolis and should be investigated.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of alternative male phenotypes is probably driven by male-male competition for access to reproductive females, but few studies have examined whether whole-organism performance capacities differ between male morphs, and if so whether any such differences affect fighting ability. We show how ontogenetic changes in performance and morphology have given rise to two distinct life-stage male morphs exhibiting different fighting tactics within the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). Field studies show a bimodal distribution of adult males within a single population: larger 'heavyweight' males have relatively large heads and high bite forces for their size, whereas smaller 'lightweight' males have smaller heads and lower bite forces. In staged fights between size-matched heavyweight males, males with greater biting ability won more frequently, whereas in lightweight fights, males with greater jumping velocity and acceleration won more often. Because growth in reptiles is indeterminate, and the anole males examined are sexually mature, we propose that the heavyweight morph arose through selection against males with small heads and poor bite forces at the lightweight-heavyweight size transition. Our findings imply that one may not be able to predict male fighting success (and hence potential mating success) by examining aspects of male 'quality' at only one life stage.},

	Abstract = {Sympatric speciation is often proposed to account for species-rich adaptive radiations within lakes or islands, where barriers to gene flow or dispersal may be lacking. However, allopatric speciation may also occur in such situations, especially when ranges are fragmented by fluctuating water levels. We test the hypothesis that Miocene fragmentation of Cuba into three palaeo-archipelagos accompanied species-level divergence in the adaptive radiation of West Indian Anolis lizards. Analysis of morphology, mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) and nuclear DNA in the Cuban green anoles (carolinensis subgroup) strongly supports three pre dictions made by this hypothesis. First, three geographical sets of populations, whose ranges correspond with palaeo-archipelago boundaries, are distinct and warrant recognition as independent evolutionary lineages or species. Coalescence of nuclear sequence fragments sampled from these species and the large divergences observed between their mtDNA haplotypes suggest separation prior to the subsequent unification of Cuba ca. 5 Myr ago. Second, molecular phylogenetic relationships among these species reflect historical geographical relationships rather than morphological similarity. Third, all three species remain distinct despite extensive geographical contact subsequent to island unification, occasional hybridization and introgression of mtDNA haplotypes. Allopatric speciation initiated during partial island submergence may play an important role in speciation during the adaptive radiation of Anolis lizards.},

@article{Hoglund:2005aa,
	Abstract = {The dopamine (DA) precursor, L-DOPA (500 microg), was injected into living crickets, which were ingested (one each) by adult male Anolis carolinensis. This method of delivery elevated plasma L-DOPA and DA concentrations by approximately 1000-fold. In contrast, plasma epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) were not influenced by L-DOPA treatment, although they were elevated following the consumption of the cricket. Lizards that ingested L-DOPA treated crickets had elevated L-DOPA in all brain regions measured, with DA and/or DOPAC also increased significantly in most brain regions studied. Despite increased DA levels in the striatum and nucleus accumbens as a response to L-DOPA, the treatment had no influence on general motor activity. Central serotonin, NE, and Epi systems were not affected in any brain region by oral L-DOPA treatment. In addition, aggression was inhibited by this dose of L-DOPA, even though there was no effect on serotonergic systems. This is surprising because controlling aggressive behavior is usually considered the province of serotonergic activity. Aggression was measured before and after treatment, and while saline-treated lizards retained the full vigor of aggressive activity, those fed a cricket injected with L-DOPA were only one-third as aggressive after treatment. As L-DOPA treatment did not affect general motor activity, the effect appears to be directly associated with aggression. This is supported by the observation that L-DOPA treatment delayed latency to eyespot darkening, which predicts the latency to aggression.},

@article{Meyer:2004aa,
	Abstract = {Social aggression in the lizard Anolis carolinensis produces dominant and subordinate relationships while elevating corticosterone levels and monoaminergic transmitter activity in hippocampus (medial and mediodorsal cortex). Adaptive social behavior for dominant and subordinate male A. carolinensis is learned during aggressive interaction and therefore was hypothesized to involve hippocampus and regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. To test the effects of social stress and corticosterone on NMDA receptor subunits (NR), male lizards were either paired or given two injections of corticosterone 1 day apart. Paired males were allowed to form dominant-subordinate relationships and were killed 1 day later. Groups included isolated controls, dominant males, subordinate males and males injected with corticosterone. Brains were processed for glutamate receptor subunit immunohistochemistry and fluorescence was analyzed by image analysis for NR(2A) and NR(2B) in the small and large cell divisions of the medial and mediodorsal cortex. In the small granule cell division there were no significant differences in NR(2A) or NR(2B) immunoreactivity among all groups. In contrast, there was a significant upregulation of NR(2A) and NR(2B) subunits in the large pyramidal cell division in all three experimental groups as compared with controls. The results revealed significantly increased NR(2A) and NR(2B) subunits in behaving animals, whereas animals simply injected with corticosterone showed less of an effect, although they were significantly increased over control. Upregulation of NR(2) subunits occurs during stressful social interactions and is likely to be regulated in part by glucocorticoids. The data also suggest that learning social roles during stressful aggressive interactions may involve NMDA receptor-mediated mechanisms.},

@article{Summers:2005ac,
	Abstract = {Stable social relationships are rearranged over time as resources such as favored territorial positions change. We test the hypotheses that social rank relationships are relatively stable, and although social signals influence aggression and rank, they are not as important as memory of an opponent. In addition, we hypothesize that eyespots, aggression and corticosterone influence serotonin and N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) systems in limbic structures involved in learning and memory. In stable adult dominant-subordinate relationships in the lizard Anolis carolinensis, social rank can be reversed by pharmacological elevation of limbic serotonergic activity. Any pair of specific experiences: behaving aggressively, viewing aggression or perceiving sign stimuli indicative of dominant rank also elevate serotonergic activity. Differences in the extent of serotonergic activation may be a discriminating and consolidating factor in attaining superior rank. For instance, socially aggressive encounters lead to increases in plasma corticosterone that stimulate both serotonergic activity and expression of the NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR(2B)) within the CA(3) region of the lizard hippocampus. Integration of these systems will regulate opponent recognition and memory, motivation to attack or retreat, and behavioral and physiological reactions to stressful social interactions. Contextually appropriate social responses provide a modifiable basis for coping with the flexibility of social relationships.},

@article{Kolbe:2004aa,
	Abstract = {A genetic paradox exists in invasion biology: how do introduced populations, whose genetic variation has probably been depleted by population bottlenecks, persist and adapt to new conditions? Lessons from conservation genetics show that reduced genetic variation due to genetic drift and founder effects limits the ability of a population to adapt, and small population size increases the risk of extinction. Nonetheless, many introduced species experiencing these same conditions during initial introductions persist, expand their ranges, evolve rapidly and become invasive. To address this issue, we studied the brown anole, a worldwide invasive lizard. Genetic analyses indicate that at least eight introductions have occurred in Florida from across this lizard's native range, blending genetic variation from different geographic source populations and producing populations that contain substantially more, not less, genetic variation than native populations. Moreover, recently introduced brown anole populations around the world originate from Florida, and some have maintained these elevated levels of genetic variation. Here we show that one key to invasion success may be the occurrence of multiple introductions that transform among-population variation in native ranges to within-population variation in introduced areas. Furthermore, these genetically variable populations may be particularly potent sources for introductions elsewhere. The growing problem of invasive species introductions brings considerable economic and biological costs. If these costs are to be mitigated, a greater understanding of the causes, progression and consequences of biological invasions is needed.},

	Abstract = {Comparatively little is known about heavy metal levels in reptiles, particularly for lizards. Yet lizards often are common predators that could serve as bioindicators of contamination on a small spatial scale. This study examined the differences in metal concentrations of adult brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, mercury, and selenium in six locations in southern Florida, USA, from Lake Okeechobee (Pahokee) south to Key West. We predicted that levels of contaminants would be higher in the industrialized ports (Port Everglades, Port of Miami) and at a landfill (in Key West) compared to a campground, tropical garden, and marine laboratory. Males were significantly larger than females, as expected. Although there were significant locational differences in metal concentrations, they did not fit a consistent pattern, either among sites or between reference and study sites. However, the lowest levels were generally found at Everglades Marina and Campground (except for selenium) and at Fairchild Tropical Garden (except for manganese). For females, size was significantly correlated with cadmium, lead, and mercury levels, while for males, there were significant correlations between length and arsenic, chromium, and manganese concentrations. Where there were gender differences in metal levels, females had significantly higher levels than males even though they were smaller. We attribute these gender differences to differences in diet due to microhabitat differences in foraging locations. Females spend more time feeding near the ground and males spend more time feeding on tree trunks and branches where they consume more flying insects. This is the first study that examines concentrations of metals in lizards in the United States, and suggests that nonnative lizards may be useful in toxicological studies.},

	Abstract = {Adaptationist theory predicts that species will evolve functional specializations for occupying different ecological niches. However, whereas performance traits are often complex, most comparative functional studies examine only simple measures of performance (e.g., sprint speed). Here we examine multiple facets of jumping biomechanics in 12 species of Caribbean Anolis lizards. These 12 species represent six ecomorphs, which are distinct ecological and morphological entities that have independently evolved on different Caribbean islands. We first show that the optimal angles for jumping maximum horizontal distances range from 39 degrees to 42 degrees, but the average jump angle of the 12 species is about 36 degrees. Interestingly, these "suboptimal" jumping angles result in only a small decrement in jump distance but substantial savings in flight duration and jump height. Further, our data show that the two key variables associated with increased jumping velocity (hindlimb length and takeoff acceleration) are independent of one another. Thus, there are two possible ways to achieve superior jumping capabilities: to evolve more muscular limbs--as stronger legs will produce more force and, hence, more acceleration--or evolve longer limbs. Our data show that anole species face trade-offs that prevent them from simultaneously optimizing different aspects of jumping ability but that they appear to have evolved behaviors that partially overcome these trade-offs.},

@article{Vlieger:2004aa,
	Abstract = {The turnip sawfly, Athalia rosae Linnaeus, is a pest on cruciferous crops. Larvae sequester secondary plant compounds, namely glucosinolates, in their haemolymph. When attacked, their integument is easily disrupted and a droplet of haemolymph is exuded ('easy bleeding'). This has been shown to be an effective, chemical-based, defence against invertebrate predators. The efficiency of this proposed defence was tested against a vertebrate predator, using groups of the iguanid lizard Anolis carolinensis Voigt as a model predator. Caterpillars of Pieris rapae Linnaeus and Pieris brassicae Linnaeus served as control prey species that do not sequester glucosinolates. Lizards attacked far fewer sawfly larvae than pierid caterpillars. Several of the sawfly larvae were rejected after an initial attack, demonstrating unpalatability to the lizards, while the Pieris larvae were not rejected. However, P. rapae larvae topically treated with extracts of haemolymph of A. rosae had no deterrent effect on the lizards and no avoidance learning occurred over a period of two weeks. Adult sawflies do not easy bleed but have glucosinolates carried over from the larval stage. Lizards attacked them at a higher rate than larvae and they were never rejected. The results suggest that for the defensive effectiveness of the pest sawfly species against vertebrates the chemical cue is not necessarily sufficient. Movement and colour may be important additional factors triggering the behaviour of vertebrate predators.},

@article{Holmes:2004aa,
	Abstract = {The copulatory system of green anoles is highly sexually dimorphic. Males possess bilateral copulatory organs called hemipenes, each independently controlled by two muscles: the transversus penis (TPN) and retractor penis magnus (RPM). The TPN everts the hemipene through the cloaca and the RPM retracts it. Adult females do not possess hemipenes or either of these two muscles. The spinal nucleus projecting to the TPN and RPM contains more and larger motoneurons in males than females. Because anoles breed seasonally, two experiments were designed to test whether adult copulatory morphology varies with environmental condition, and if so, whether the effect is mediated by testicular androgens. Three groups of adult males were used in each experiment: males from breeding environmental conditions with reproductive testes (BS); males in breeding conditions with regressed testes (BS-X); and males in nonbreeding conditions with regressed testes (NBS). Experiment 1 compared gonadally intact males and Experiment 2 compared castrated males treated with either testosterone (T) or an empty implant. In both experiments, copulatory and control motoneurons appeared smaller in NBS males, but T did not affect their size. In contrast, while hemipene and RPM muscle fiber size were not plastic across season in gonadally intact males, T in castrated males significantly increased both measures under BS and BS-X, but not NBS, conditions. These results demonstrate that neuron soma size might change on a general level and environmental cues can mediate T-induced changes in peripheral structures, suggesting that plasticity across copulatory system components is regulated by different mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {The bimaculatus group of anoles inhabit the northern Lesser Antilles, as far south as Dominica. This study uses 1005 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA sequence data from two genes, cytochrome b (521 bp) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (484 bp) to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships between species and populations of anoles from all islands banks. Allele frequency data from nuclear microsatellite loci are also analysed to assess their utility in uncovering historical relationships and provide independent corroboration for the mtDNA tree. Although the number of microsatellite loci used (six) was relatively small, some essential elements of the mitochondrial DNA phylogeny were recovered successfully. Anoles from Terre de Haut, Les Saintes, previously described as a subspecies of Anolis marmoratus, are shown to be more closely related to A. oculatus and their elevation to a full species, A. terraealtae, is supported. An island colonisation sequence inferred from the phylogeny shows a general pattern of North-to South colonisation. However, the Saban anole, A. sabanus, is shown to be derived from A. marmoratus populations from western Basse Terre following a longer-range, south to north translocation.},

Parallopharynx gonzalezi, which was originally described in Basiliscus sp. and Ctenosoura similis from central Costa Rica, inhabits C. quinquecarinata; P. jonesi, originally described in Anolis lionotus (syn. Norops oxylophus) from Nicaragua, inhabits N. oxylophus, N. biporcatus, and Basiliscus basiliscus; and the new species, which inhabits B. basiliscus. Parallopharynx matternae n. sp. differs from all other members of the genus by having a metraterm extending posteriad from the genital pore to the posterior margin of the ventral sucker, whereas in P. arctus and P. gonzalezi, the metraterm never surpasses the midlevel of the ventral sucker and in P. jonesi it never passes the anterior margin of the ventral sucker, and by having an oral sucker that does not exceed 150 microm in diameter with a subsequent greater oral-ventral sucker width ratio ranging from 1:0.88-1.12 (averaging 1:1), whereas values range from 1:0.71-0.83 for P. gonzalezi and P. arctus, and from 1:0.59-0.68 for P. jonesi. Parallopharynx spp. possesses Y-shaped excretory vesicles with a long central stem and short arms bifurcating immediately posterior to the ovary; similar to those found in members of the Telorchiidae. Additional similarities in the relative positions of the gonads and the structure of the cirrus sac and metraterm indicate a close relationship between Parallopharynx and members of the Telorchiidae.},

	Abstract = {Arboreal animals often move in habitats with dense vegetation, narrow perches and variable inclines, but effects of arboreal habitat structure on locomotor function are poorly understood for most animals. Several species of Anolis lizards, which have served as a model group for relating locomotor performance to morphology, have decreased maximal sprinting speeds when perch diameter decreases. However, the effects of perch diameter on the limb movements of Anolis have not been previously studied. Hence, we quantified the hindlimb movements of Anolis sagrei, which naturally occurs on a wide variety of perch diameters and inclines. We analyzed similar speeds of steady locomotion for combinations of flat surfaces and round perches with diameters of 1, 3, 6 and 10 cm and inclines of 0 degrees and uphill 45 degrees and 90 degrees. Diameter significantly affected more kinematic variables than incline, but many kinematic variables changed little with increases in diameter beyond 6 cm. As surface diameter increased, the limb posture of A. sagrei became progressively more sprawled. Significantly greater knee flexion during stance was important for locating the foot more medially during movement on narrow perches. Stride length increased and femur depression, femur retraction and long-axis femur rotation decreased significantly as the surface diameter increased. The low hip heights on the vertical incline and the narrowest perches suggest that bringing the center of mass closer to the locomotor surface is important in these circumstances for reducing the tendency to topple backwards or sideways. Most of the kinematic changes of A. sagrei with decreased perch diameter were opposite those correlated with increased speeds of locomotion for terrestrial lizards. The foot was most lateral to the hip during the swing phase and maximal lateral displacements decreased with decreased perch diameter. Consequently, the width required to accommodate limb movement also decreased as perch diameter decreased.},

	Abstract = {As more data have become available on lizard diets in the past few decades, researchers have stressed the importance of lizards as pollinators and seed dispersers. Whereas large body size has been traditionally put forward as a major biological factor "allowing" herbivory and frugivory in lizards, a recent review of frugivory and seed dispersal by lizards showed that frugivory might be considered to be a typical island phenomenon, independent of body size. Here we show that frugivory is correlated with lizard body size among a group of syntopic Anolis species in Jamaica, with larger species eating more fruit. Additionally, the size of the fruits consumed is significantly related to lizard body size. Multiple regression analyses show that this is largely a pure body size effect as head shape or residual bite force are uncorrelated to overall fruit size. Moreover, we demonstrate that among polychrotid (Anolis-like) lizards in general, those that consume fruit are on average larger than those that do not. Lizards from the mainland were not significantly different in body size from island species. We thus suggest that fruit consumption in polychrotid lizards is mediated by large body size whether living on islands or not.},

@article{Lovern:2004aa,
	Abstract = {Male green anole lizards court females using a red throat fan (dewlap) and copulate by intromitting one of two penises (hemipenes). These structures begin sexually monomorphic, but by adulthood males have larger dewlaps, only males have hemipenes, and many of the neuromuscular components of both systems show male-biased dimorphisms. We hypothesized that testosterone (T), which increases in juvenile males but not females about a month after hatching, facilitates masculinization. To test this idea, on post-hatching day 30, gonadally intact females received either a blank or T implant, and males were either castrated or sham-castrated. At day 90, juveniles were euthanized and the length of the cartilage and cross-sectional areas of the muscle fibers and motoneurons required for dewlap extension were examined. We also measured the cross-sectional areas of the hemipenes and associated muscle fibers and motoneurons, and counted the motoneurons. T-treated females had longer cartilages and larger dewlap muscle fibers compared to those with blank implants. No effects on motoneurons were detected, and no females possessed hemipenes or associated musculature. In males, castration produced shorter dewlap cartilages and smaller hemipenes; other measures were not affected by treatment. These data indicate that components of the dewlap system differentiate relatively late in development, that T likely mediates the process, and that although components of the copulatory system are plastic in juvenile males, sexual differentiation of peripheral features is complete before day 30. The data also suggest that target structures (dewlap cartilage and hemipenes), compared to their neuromuscular effectors, are particularly sensitive to developmental T exposure.},

@article{Orrell:2004aa,
	Abstract = {Although the amount of energy that males and females invest in reproduction is an integral component of theories explaining the evolution of particular mating strategies, few studies have actually determined the amount of energy that each sex allocates to reproduction. We compared how energy is expended by male and female Anolis carolinensis lizards during both the breeding and postbreeding seasons. We used laboratory respirometry to determine resting metabolic rates (RMRs) of inactive, freshly captured lizards and the doubly labeled water technique to determine field metabolic rates (FMRs) of free-ranging lizards. Both RMRs and FMRs were influenced by body mass but not by sex. Season did not influence FMRs; however, RMRs of both sexes increased approximately 40% from the breeding to the postbreeding season. The seasonal increase in RMRs was attributed to a postreproductive increase in feeding rate and specific dynamic action. We used RMRs, FMRs, and thermal profiles of lizards to calculate energy budgets for breeding and postbreeding seasons. Energy budgets partitioned daily field energy (DFE; calculated from FMRs) into daily activity energy (DAE) and daily resting energy (DRE; calculated from RMRs). Energy expended for reproduction was estimated as DAE during the breeding season plus egg production (for females). Despite males having 40% greater body mass, females expended 46% more energy for reproduction than did males (906 and 619 J/d, respectively). Total metabolizable energy (TME=DFE+egg production for females) expended during the breeding season was similar for males and females (1,280 and 1,365 J/d, respectively). Although TME of females decreased 44% from the breeding to the postbreeding season (1,365 vs. 766 J/d), TME of males was similar during both seasons (1,280 vs. 1,245 J/d). There were both seasonal and sexual differences in DRE and DAE. Compared with most lizards from semiarid/desert habitats, A. carolinensis in a temperate habitat expends more total energy during the breeding season, allocates more energy to eggs, and appears to have more total energy available for reproduction.},

@article{Rosen:2004aa,
	Abstract = {Throat fan (dewlap) extension is sexually dimorphic in green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis). Males have larger dewlaps which they display more frequently than females. Correlated with the behavior, sexual dimorphisms occur in the skeletal, muscular and neural structures responsible for dewlap extension in green anoles. We used histochemical techniques to stain for myosin ATPase and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) to determine whether sex differences also exist in fiber type composition of the ceratohyoideus, the muscle that extends the dewlap. Based on the staining pattern for the two enzymes, four fiber types were identified: fast-oxidative-glycolytic (FOG), fast-glycolytic (FG), slow-oxidative (SO), and tonic. In the ceratohyoideus of both sexes, the predominate fiber types were FOG (approximately 43%) and FG (approximately 34%). Also in both males and females, the FOG and FG fibers had approximately twice the cross-sectional area of the SO and tonic fibers. No sex differences occurred in the percentages of FOG and FG fibers. However, males had a greater percentage of tonic fibers than females, whereas females had a greater percentage of SO fibers than males. The high proportion of FOG fibers in the anole ceratohyoideus makes it similar to other relatively fatigue-resistant muscles used in movements of moderate speed and duration. Although the precise role of tonic fibers in dewlap extension is not known, the greater percentage of these fibers in the male ceratohyoideus might be required to stabilize or maintain extension of the large dewlap apparatus in males.},

	Abstract = {We tested the prediction of the sensory drive hypothesis using four allopatric populations of the lizard Anolis cristatellus from two distinct environments (i.e., mesic and xeric conditions). For each population, we measured habitat light characteristics and quantified signal design by measuring the spectral and total reflectance and transmittance of the dewlap. We used these data to calculate dewlap detectability using an empirically based model of signal detection probability. We found that populations from mesic and xeric conditions occupy two distinct habitats with respect to light intensity and spectral quality and that dewlap design has diverged between populations in a way that increases signal detectability in each habitat. The major difference in dewlap design was in total reflectance and transmittance, making dewlaps from xeric habitats darker and dewlaps from mesic habitats brighter. Furthermore, dewlap detection decreased significantly when a dewlap from a xeric habitat is detected under the spectral conditions of a mesic habitat. The converse is true for a dewlap from a mesic habitat. We propose that sensory drive has promoted divergence in dewlap design in distinct habitat light conditions, and we discuss the possibility that selection might promote early stages of reproductive isolation as a by-product of selection on dewlap design to distinct habitat light conditions.},

This lizard has been the subject of behavioral and ecological study for more than 100 yr, and a rich literature exists on its natural history. Both courtship and copulatory behaviors reveal sex and seasonal differences, which allow for the study of mechanisms regulation naturally occurring variation in performance at multiple levels within a single animal model. Green anoles are readily obtained due to their abundance in the wild; once in the laboratory, they are easily maintained, bred, and reared. Background on the natural history and husbandry of this lizard is provided, and the authors' research program on the regulation of reproductive anatomy and behavior is reviewed, Discussion includes the similarities and differences in the mechanisms mediating both structure and function compared with more traditional animal models.

	Abstract = {Serotonergic activity is influenced by social status and manipulation of social signals. In the lizard Anolis carolinensis, eyespot formation, i.e. darkening of postorbital skin from green to black, appears during stressful and agonistic situations, forming first in males that become dominant. To assess the effect of eyespots on central serotonergic activity during social interaction, males were paired by weight and painted postorbitally with green or black paint. Manipulation of eyespot color influenced social interactions and status. All males that viewed an opponent with black painted eyespots became subordinate. In these subordinate animals, serotonergic activity was elevated in hippocampus, striatum, nucleus accumbens and locus ceruleus. In contrast, males that viewed opponents with hidden eyespots (painted green) and became dominant had increased serotonergic activity in hypothalamus, medial amygdala and raphe. Pre-painted eyespots produced results that distinguish dominant and subordinate relationships based on serotonergic activity not previously seen in unmanipulated pairs. Results from experiments using pairs are similar to those using mirrors for medial amygdala and locus ceruleus, but not hippocampus, nucleus accumbens or raphe. Decreased hypothalamic serotonin was associated with increased aggressive behavior. These results, when compared with previous studies, suggest some flexibility in central serotonergic systems, which may shape dominant and subordinate rank acquisition, and appear to be influenced by the completion of social role formation. Furthermore, social status and central serotonergic activity was influenced by a visual cue, the presence or absence of postorbital eyespots on an opponent.},

	Abstract = {We used changes in body color and eyespot formation, two somatic indices of stress controlled mainly by catecholamine activity, to compare the reactions of dominant and subordinate male green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) to a nonsocial stressor, forced movement. Individual males were pretested by subjecting them to 10 min of forced movement induced by chasing them around their home cage with a slender wooden stick. Stress responses were assayed via changes in body color (progressive darkening from green to brown indicating increasing stress) and expression of a black postorbital eyespot (which appears with increasing catecholaminergic stress responses). Lizards were paired and allowed to form stable dominant/subordinate relationships for 2 weeks. After that period of stable social status, dominants and subordinates were separated and subjected to the same forced-movement stress. There was no difference between experimental groups in the pretest. After assuming positions in the dominance hierarchy, however, dominant males showed reduced somatic indicators of stress and were quicker to recover from the stress. The data suggest that animals that assumed the dominant position decreased their stress response relative to the pretest, while animals that assumed the subordinate position increased their stress response relative to the pretest. The results indicate that dominant social status may have advantages beyond the realm of social interactions by enhancing an individual's ability to tolerate other, nonsocial stressful events.},

	Abstract = {Islands are considered to be natural laboratories in which to examine evolution because of the implicit assumption that limited gene flow allows tests of evolutionary processes in isolated replicates. Here we show that this well-accepted idea requires re-examination. Island inundation during hurricanes can have devastating effects on lizard populations in the Bahamas. After severe storms, islands may be recolonized by over-water dispersal of lizards from neighbouring islands. High levels of gene flow may homogenize genes responsible for divergence, and are widely viewed as a constraining force on evolution. Ultimately, the magnitude of gene flow determines the extent to which populations diverge from one another, and whether or not they eventually form new species. We show that patterns of gene flow among island populations of Anolis lizards are best explained by prevailing ocean currents, and that over-water dispersal has evolutionary consequences. Across islands, divergence in fitness-related morphology decreases with increasing gene flow. Results suggest that over-water dispersal after hurricanes constrains adaptive diversification in Anolis lizards, and that it may have an important but previously undocumented role in this classical example of adaptive radiation.},

	Abstract = {Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles partition the structural microhabitats available at a given site into four to six distinct categories. Most microhabitat specialists, or ecomorphs, have evolved only once on each island, yet closely related species of the same ecomorph occur in different geographic macrohabitats across the island. The extent to which closely related species of the same ecomorph have diverged to adapt to different geographic macrohabitats is largely undocumented. On the island of Hispaniola, members of the Anolis cybotes species group belong to the trunk-ground ecomorph category. Despite evolutionary stability of their trunk-ground microhabitat, populations of the A. cybotes group have undergone an evolutionary radiation associated with geographically distinct macrohabitats. A combined phylogeographic and morphometric study of this group reveals a strong association between macrohabitat type and morphology independent of phylogeny. This association results from long-term morphological evolutionary stasis in populations associated with mesic-forest environments (A. c. cybotes and A. marcanoi) and predictable morphometric changes associated with entry into new macrohabitat types (i.e., xeric forests, high-altitude pine forest, rock outcrops). Phylogeographic analysis of 73 new mitochondrial DNA sequences (1921 aligned sites) sampled from 68 geographic populations representing 12 recognized species and subspecies diagnoses 16 allopatric or parapatric groupings of populations differing from each other by 5-18% sequence divergence. At least some of these groupings appear to have attained species-level divergence from others. Evolutionary specialization to different macrohabitat types may be a major factor in the evolutionary diversification of Greater Antillean anoles.},

	Abstract = {Aggressive encounters are accompanied by a release of stress hormone, and this corticosterone (CORT) secretion could influence aggressive behavior in subsequent encounters. We investigated the modulating effects of CORT on aggressive behavior in the context of a 5-day social experience in male green anole lizards. In Experiment 1, we measured plasma CORT levels in animals that were exposed for different times to aggressive males. In Experiment 2, using metyrapone, a CORT synthesis blocker, we tested whether CORT secretion in response to the aggressive stimulus plays a role in experience-dependent facilitation of aggressive behavior. We hypothesized that aggressive encounters would increase plasma CORT levels, and that blocking CORT synthesis with metyrapone treatment during the aggressive encounter would cause an animal to become more aggressive. We also tested whether blocking CORT would interfere with the influence of 5-day social experience on animals' behavior in a subsequent aggressive encounter. Animals that were exposed to another male showed higher plasma CORT levels immediately after the 10 min encounter than animals exposed to the non-social video, and this high level was maintained through day 5. Within the aggressive video groups, in Experiment 2, there was a distinctly different pattern in displays depending on drug condition: vehicle-injected animals showed gradual increases followed by decreases in aggressive behavioral responses to the video as the five days proceeded (habituation), while animals injected with metyrapone started out with high aggressive behavior and did not decrease behavioral responses at later trials (no habituation). Finally, when tested with a novel conspecific on day 6, animals previously injected with metyrapone showed no higher aggression than did animals previously injected with vehicle and exposed to the aggressive video. These results suggest that blocking CORT synthesis during the exposure to the aggressive video induced animals to remain aggressive toward the repetitive stimulus without habituating, while not becoming more aggressive than controls toward a novel challenger.},

	Abstract = {The sex steroids testosterone (T) and estradiol-17beta (E2) play important roles in vertebrate reproduction and development. However, little is known about the relationship between plasma steroid levels (which can influence reproductive function) and yolk steroid levels (which can influence embryonic development) in oviparous species. Therefore, we examined the extent to which T and E2 are coupled in plasma and yolking follicles in adult females and explored the dynamics of yolk and embryo steroid content during egg incubation in green anoles (Anolis carolinensis). T and E2 levels were determined for the plasma and yolking follicles of breeding females and for whole embryos and yolks at several developmental stages by radioimmunoassay. Plasma and yolk concentrations of T and E2 were not correlated. On average, plasma T was only 30% that of plasma E2, but yolking follicle T was over 600% that of yolking follicle E2. Total yolk T and E2 content generally declined over the course of incubation. However, yolk T was an order of magnitude higher than yolk E2, and it showed a secondary peak in magnitude after approximately 75% of incubation was completed. Similarly, total embryonic T content rose by over 400% in the latter half of incubation whereas E2 did not change. These results demonstrate that plasma and yolking follicle steroid levels produced by breeding females can be uncoupled. Furthermore, embryos themselves may begin producing T, but likely not E2, during the latter stages of incubation. Thus, steroid exposure may be independently shaped by selection to serve both reproductive and developmental functions.},

	Abstract = {Complex, situation-specific territorial maintenance routines are similar across living terrestrial vertebrates (=amniotes). Decades ago, Paul MacLean et al., at the Laboratory of Brain Evolution and Behavior of the National Institute of Mental Health, postulated that these are evolutionarily conserved behaviors whose expression is mediated by the similarly conserved amniote basal ganglia and related brain systems (BG systems). Therefore, they undertook studies in nonhuman primates and in small social lizards (the common green anole, Anolis carolinensis) to examine this idea. MacLean et al. also postulated that when BG systems misfunction in humans, behavioral abnormalities result, some of them under the rubric of psychiatric illnesses. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was singled out as one likely candidate. In the last dozen years, functional brain imaging studies of OCD patients have validated the contention that this is, in fact, a condition involving dysfunctioning BG systems. Inspired by the MacLean group's original investigations, my colleagues and I have now applied related functional imaging techniques in naturalistic experiments using Anolis to better understand BG systems' roles in the mediation of complex behavioral routines in healthy amniotes. Here, I will review this functional imaging work in primates (man, and a little in monkey) and in lizards. I believe the literature not only supports MacLean et al.'s contentions about BG systems and behavior in general, but also validates Paul MacLean's life-long contention that human behavioral medicine can profit from a broad comparative approach.},

	Abstract = {The green anolis lizard, Anolis carolinensis, is a uniquely convenient species with great potential for providing insights about the causes and consequences of social behavior from an evolutionary perspective. In this species, social interactions are mediated by visual displays in which specific units of behavior are combined in various ways to communicate several more-or-less specific messages. Two related research programs that utilize this species converge in provocative ways to provide insight into this phenomenon. The first program is centered on the basal ganglia, now known to be crucial to the expression of aggressive territoriality in this species, and the second research program examines the way the physiological stress response is involved in aggression and its subsequent adaptive outcomes. Both the neural and the neuroendocrine systems affect the progress of social interactions as well as the subsequent social dominance relationships when combatants subsequently live together. Further, because body color depends almost exclusively on the stress response, skin color provides a unique in situ bioassay of otherwise inaccessible information about the animal's internal state. The fullest understanding of the physiological ethology of this model species will depend on an interdisciplinary approach that considers both proximate (physiological) and ultimate (evolutionary) causes of displays. Questions thus arising include how the nervous system controls and assembles the specific units of behavior-motor patterns and autonomic reflexes-into displays that are adaptive in specific contexts.},

	Abstract = {Studies on the lizard, Anolis sagrei, revealed that after Hurricane Floyd devastated the Bahamas in 1999, some populations consisted only of hatchlings. Because the storm surge of the hurricane completely inundated these islands, apparently for up to 6 h, survival of anole eggs in salt water for such periods is implied. To test this hypothesis directly, we placed A. sagrei eggs in saltwater for 3 or 6 h with unimmersed eggs serving as the control. Hatching success and incubation time did not differ among the three treatments. These findings help explain the persistence of anole populations on small islands vulnerable to hurricanes.},

	Abstract = {A regulated decrease in internal body temperature (Tb) appears to play a protective role against metabolic disruptions such as exposure to ambient hypoxia. This study examined the possibility that Tb depression is initiated when low internal oxygen levels trigger the release of adenosine, a neural modulator known to influence thermoregulation. We measured selected Tb of Anolis sagrei in a thermal gradient under varied ambient oxygen conditions and following the administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline (CPT). The average decrease in Tb observed following exposure to hypoxia (<10% O2) and following exhaustive exercise were 5 degrees and 3 degrees C, respectively, suggesting a role of oxygen availability on initiation of regulated hypothermia. When A. sagrei were run to exhaustion and recovered in hyperoxic (>95% O2) conditions, exercise-induced Tb depression was abolished. Administration of CPT similarly abolished decreased Tb due to both exercise and hypoxia. Trials using Dipsosaurus dorsalis indicate that elevated ambient oxygen during exercise does not influence blood pH or lactate accumulation, suggesting that these factors do not initiate changes in thermoregulatory setpoint following exhaustive exercise. We suggest that when oxygen is limiting, a decrease in arterial oxygen may trigger the release of adenosine, thereby altering the thermoregulatory setpoint.},

	Abstract = {The importance of accommodating the phylogenetic history of a group when performing a comparative analysis is now widely recognized. The typical approaches either assume the tree is known without error, or they base inferences on a collection of well-supported trees or on a collection of trees generated under a stochastic model of cladogenesis. However, these approaches do not adequately account for the uncertainty of phylogenetic trees in a comparative analysis, especially when data relevant to the phylogeny of a group are available. Here, we develop a method for performing comparative analyses that is based on an extension of Felsenstein's independent contrasts method. Uncertainties in the phylogeny, branch lengths, and other parameters are accommodated by averaging over all possible trees, weighting each by the probability that the tree is correct. We do this in a Bayesian framework and use Markov chain Monte Carlo to perform the high-dimensional summations and integrations required by the analysis. We illustrate the method using comparative characters sampled from Anolis lizards.},

	Abstract = {Signal ontogeny was examined in green anoles (Anolis carolinensis). From 1,246 head bob displays given by 114 juveniles, it was found that juveniles possessed all 3 display types (A, B, and C) described for adults and that C displays were present at hatching, but A and B displays appeared to emerge gradually from a common precursor. Durations of the head bobs and pauses that make up juvenile displays tended to be more variable (i.e., less stereotyped) than those of adult displays. However, within the juvenile class, sex, age (or size), social context, and rearing environment (field or lab) had no effect on display structure or stereotypy. Thus, in contrast to typical signal ontogeny in songbirds and mammals, components of the green anole signal repertoire are expressed from early development. Similar to signal ontogeny in altricial species, maturation is nevertheless important for the complete and stereotyped expression of the adult signal repertoire.},

	Abstract = {Scaling models predict how functional variables change as animals grow or increase in size evolutionarily. However, few experimental studies have found support for the predictions of these models. Here, we use a force plate to investigate the scaling of functional variables associated with jumping within (for three species) and across adults of 12 species of Anolis lizards. Both ontogenetically (with the exception of Anolis carolinensis) and across the 12 species examined, limb dimensions increased geometrically, making Anolis lizards an ideal study system to test the predictions of geometric scaling models. However, both the ontogenetic and interspecific scaling of functional variables deviated in several aspects from model predictions. Unexpectedly, the scaling of functional variables such as acceleration differed for different species. Whereas acceleration capacity increases with hindlimb length for A. carolinensis, no relationship was detected for the other two species. Interspecifically, the inclusion of two large species in our analysis appears to drive the absence of a correlation between acceleration capacity and hindlimb length across species. These data suggest that selection for enhanced jumping performance is relaxed in larger anoles and support the notion that no scaling model seems to be able to comprehensively predict changes in function with size across species; rather, natural selection seems to drive changes in the scaling relationships of some key variables such as force output or acceleration capacity.},

	Abstract = {Some biologists embrace the classical view that changes in behavior inevitably initiate or drive evolutionary changes in other traits, yet others note that behavior sometimes inhibits evolutionary changes. Here we develop a null model that quantifies the impact of regulatory behaviors (specifically, thermoregulatory behaviors) on body temperature and on performance of ectotherms. We apply the model to data on a lizard (Anolis cristatellus) and show that thermoregulatory behaviors likely inhibit selection for evolutionary shifts in thermal physiology with altitude. Because behavioral adjustments are commonly used by ectotherms to regulate physiological performance, regulatory behaviors should generally constrain rather than drive evolution, a phenomenon we call the "Bogert effect." We briefly review a few other examples that contradict the classical view of behavior as the inevitable driving force in evolution. Overall, our analysis and brief review challenge the classical view that behavior is invariably the driving force in evolution, and instead our work supports the alternative view that behavior has diverse--and sometimes conflicting--effects on the directions and rates at which other traits evolve.},

	Abstract = {Central serotonin (5-HT) is activated during stressful situations and aggressive interactions in a number of species. Glucocorticoids secreted peripherally during stressful events feed back on central systems and may affect 5-HT mediation of stress-induced behavioral events. To test the neuromodulatory effect of stress hormone secretion, serotonin overflow was measured from the hippocampus of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. Microdialysis was used to collect repeated samples from anesthetized lizards, with perfusate measured by HPLC with electrochemical analysis. Following initially high levels of 5-HT, concentrations stabilized to basal levels after approximately 2 h. Intracortical infusion of 200 ng/ml corticosterone evoked transient increases in 5-HT release of approximately 400%. The effect of corticosterone on 5-HT overflow appears to be dose dependent as 20 ng/ml stimulated an increase of 200%, whereas 2 ng/ml stimulated a 50% increase. Administration of 0.1 and 1 ng/ml GABA via the dialysis probe significantly inhibited 5-HT overflow by 20 and 40%, respectively. The duration of GABA inhibition is greater than the stimulatory response for glucocorticoids. Short-lived glucocorticoid stimulation of 5-HT release suggests a possible mechanism for endocrine mediation of continuously changing social behavioral events.},

	Abstract = {Dominant and subordinate males respond differently to the stress of social interaction. After an hour of social interaction, subordinate male Anolis carolinensis have elevated serotonergic activity in hippocampus, but dominant males do not. In other species, and using other stressors, the activation of hippocampal serotonergic activity is much more rapid than one hour. To elucidate early stress responsiveness, adult male A. carolinensis were divided into four groups: isolated controls, and pairs of males sampled after 10, 20 or 40 minutes of aggressive interaction. Development of dominant-subordinate relationships was determined by behavior and by the celerity of eyespot darkening. Serotonergic activity in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and amygdala was elevated rapidly and equally in both dominant and subordinate males, as were plasma corticosterone concentrations. Serotonergic activity remained elevated through 40 minutes in hippocampus and nucleus accumbens. Only subordinate males had elevated corticosterone levels at 40 minutes. Social status does not impede socially induced stress responses. Rather, rapid regulation of serotonergic stress responses appears to be a mediating factor in determining both behavioral output and social status. Temporal expressions of monoaminergic and endocrine stress responses are distinctive between males of dominant and subordinate social status. Such temporal patterns of transmitter and glucocorticoid activity may reflect neurocircuitry adaptations that result in behavior modified to fit social status.},

	Abstract = {In the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), a lizard with genotypic sex determination, yolk testosterone (T) concentration is greater in male-producing than female-producing eggs at oviposition, but the source and potential effects were not clear from previous studies. If yolk T levels are also sex-specific before eggs are laid, a period during which embryonic steroidogenesis is unlikely, it would strongly suggest that the difference in yolk T is maternally derived. We collected yolk samples from eggs shelling within the oviducts of anesthetized females, and then allowed these females to lay the eggs naturally. Eggs were incubated to hatching to determine sex morphologically, and yolk T concentrations were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. As is the case just after they are laid, yolk T is higher in male than female oviductal eggs. To our knowledge, this is the earliest sex difference reported for any yolk steroid. We suggest that maternally derived yolk T levels could influence sex by differentially affecting male- and female-inducing sperm, because fertilization occurs after yolk deposition and ovulation, while the egg is in the oviduct. Our results, together with those of an increasing number of studies, suggest that a relationship between hormones and vertebrate sex determination may be more widespread than generally appreciated.},

@article{Thorpe:2003aa,
	Abstract = {Martinique is an environmentally heterogeneous island with a complex geological history. It is occupied by a solitary anole, Anolis roquet, showing marked geographical variation in colour and other features. Phylogenetic analysis of a segment (1 kb) of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene across the Anolis roquet series in the southern Lesser Antilles and at 63 localities of Anolis roquet in Martinique indicate that A. roquet is paraphyletic as A. extremus (Barbados) is nested within the Martinique populations. Moreover, divergent phylogenetic lineages exist within Martinique (max. 10.6% uncorrected pairwise), and these lineages are closely associated with the geological history of this complex island. However, objective quantification of the spectroradiometric analysis of hue by delta analysis, together with analysis of the colour pattern, indicate that they are primarily determined by adaptation to environmental conditions, irrespective of these phylogenetic lineages. There is remarkable convergence in hue and pattern in both extreme xeric (dark chevrons on a dull, generally grey/brown, background), and montane conditions (black reticulation and non-UV white spots on a bright, saturated green background). Moreover, parallel trends occur between Martinique and other Lesser Antillean anoles, which further argues for adaptation (increase in green saturation in montane areas and higher levels of UV on the dewlap of some Atlantic forms). As an exception, there are two specific situations where anoles from different lineages look different. These are (i). in the low-altitude regions of the northwest where the northwestern and central lineages make contact, and (ii). in the far south of the island where the southern and central lineages meet.},

	Abstract = {The ability of 14 structurally diverse estrogenic compounds to induce reporter gene expression mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs) from different species was examined. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with a Gal4-regulated luciferase reporter gene (17m5-G-Luc) and Gal4-ER chimeric receptors containing the D, E and F domains of the human alpha (Gal4-hERalphadef), mouse alpha (Gal4-mERalphadef), mouse beta (Gal4-mERbetadef), chicken (Gal4-cERalphadef), green anole (Gal4-aERalphadef), Xenopus (Gal4-xERdef) or rainbow trout alpha ERs (Gal4-rtERalphadef). The efficacy of 17beta-estradiol (E2) in inducing reporter gene expression was similar among the different constructs overall, with EC(50) values ranging from 0.05 to 0.7nM. However, Gal4-rtERalphadef had an EC(50) value at 37 degrees C of 28nM, though at 20 degrees C an EC(50) value of 1nM was observed. Despite a similar response to E2 treatment among the ERs, many differences were observed in the magnitude of the response to other structurally diverse chemicals. For example, coumestrol induced Gal4-mERbetadef- and Gal4-aERdef-mediated reporter gene expression 164- and 8-fold greater, respectively, than mediated with the other Gal4-ERs. As well, in contrast to results with other Gal4-ERs, alpha-zearalenol consistently induced Gal4-rtERalphadef-mediated reporter gene activity at lower concentrations than did E2. Overall, the results demonstrate that selected estrogenic compounds exhibit a differential ability to induce reporter gene activity mediated by ERs from different vertebrate species. These data also highlight the importance of incubation temperature when examining rtERalpha-mediated activity.},

	Abstract = {Darkening of postorbital skin (eyespots) in Anolis carolinensis occurs during stressful situations via adrenal catecholaminergic activation of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. The eyespots form more rapidly in dominant males during social interaction. It was hypothesized that eyespot darkening from green to black is a social signal that communicates disposition, resulting from sympathetic activation and determines social hierarchy. To assess the value of the eyespot as a signal influencing social dominance, males were paired according to size and weight, and painted postorbitally; one with green and the other with black paint. Painted pairs interacted with aggressive displays, approaches, and bites. Dominant status was determined by continued displacement of an opponent, superior perching position, and lighter color. Males with eyespots darkened by black paint were dominant in 100% of interactions and more aggressive. Males viewing an opponent with eyespots painted black exhibited higher plasma epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) levels than males with eyespots hidden with green paint and isolated controls. Results for behavior were similar, but those for plasma catecholamines contrast with those from recent experiments in which interactions occurred vs. a mirrored reflection. The eyespot is a potent stimulus, acting as a social signal that confers dominant status to its bearer, and activates the sympathetic nervous system in opponents that observe it during aggressive interactions.},

This paper describes a study in which molecular markers were used to examine the effects of allopatric divergence and habitat on levels of gene flow in the Caribbean lizard, Anolis roquet. Three study transects were constructed to compare variation in microsatellite allele frequencies and morphology across phylogenetic and habitat boundaries in northern Martinique. Results showed reductions in gene flow to be concordant with divergent selection for habitat type. No evidence could be found for divergence in allopatry influencing current gene flow. Morphological data match these findings, with multivariate analysis showing correlation with habitat type but no grouping by phylogenetic lineage. The results support the ecological speciation model of evolutionary divergence, indicating the importance of habitats in biodiversity generation.},

@article{Yang:2002aa,
	Abstract = {We investigated the relationship between aggressive behavior and circulating androgens in the context of agonistic social interaction and examined the effect of this interaction on the androgen-aggression relationship in response to a subsequent social challenge in male Anolis carolinensis lizards. Individuals comprising an aggressive encounter group were exposed to an aggressive conspecific male for 10 min per day during a 5-day encounter period, while controls were exposed to a neutral stimulus for the same period. On the sixth day, their responses to an intruder test were observed. At intervals, individuals were sacrificed to monitor plasma androgen levels. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test three a priori interaction models of the relationship between social stimulus, aggressive behavior, and androgen. Model 1 posits that exposure to a social stimulus influences androgen and aggressive behavior independently. In Model 2, a social stimulus triggers aggressive behavior, which in turn increases circulating levels of androgen. In Model 3, exposure to a social stimulus influences circulating androgen levels, which in turn triggers aggressive behavior. During the 5 days of the encounter period, circulating testosterone (T) levels of the aggressive encounter group followed the same pattern as their aggressive behavioral responses, while the control group did not show significant changes in their aggressive behavior or T level. Our SEM results supported Model 2. A means analysis showed that during the intruder test, animals with 5 days of aggressive encounters showed more aggressive responses than did control animals, while their circulating androgen levels did not differ. This further supports Model 2, suggesting that an animal's own aggressive behavior may trigger increases in levels of plasma androgen.},

	Abstract = {The use of color (as distinct from color pattern) in comparative evolutionary studies is important, and objective, independent characters are needed. A new method was employed to investigate geographic color variation in the small arboreal lizard Anolis trinitatis on the island of St. Vincent. The simple delta analysis (based on the difference between eigenvector coefficients for adjacent regions of the spectrum) is aimed at increasing the objectivity with which a spectrum is cut into independent segments and does not predetermine segment width or number. There are distinct habitat types within this small island and distinct phylogenetic lineages (based on a kilobase of cytochrome b sequence) within this species. A series of matrix correspondence (Mantel) tests indicate that aspects of color are associated with habitat type (e.g., green dorsum in rain forest lizards), molecular phylogeny, or both. Hence, both adaptation by selection and historical processes are implicated as causes of geographic variation in color. The dewlap variation (e.g., strong ultraviolet reflectance in some Atlantic coastal sites) is very pronounced and, contrary to some expectations, may result in reproductive isolation even within small Lesser Antillean islands.},

	Abstract = {Allele frequency data from nuclear microsatellite loci were used to investigate patterns of nuclear gene flow and population structure in the morphologically variable Dominican anole (Anolis oculatus). All six loci used proved to be highly polymorphic, with an average of 18.8 alleles per locus. Test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium revealed small numbers of heterozygote deficiencies at single loci in single populations and consistent patterns of increasingly significant heterozygote deficiency in global tests across populations and loci. No significant relationship between FST and patristic distances estimated from mitochondrial DNA sequences was detected and estimates of FIS were significantly higher in females than in males, indicating that gene flow may be sex-biased and mediated mainly by male migration. A highly significant correlation between linearized FST and loge (geographical distance) indicates that geographical proximity is a significant factor in the genetic structure of A. oculatus populations. However, levels of gene flow between morphologically differentiated parapatric populations are frequently seen to be relatively high. This supports the hypothesis of natural selection being the driving force behind the development and maintenance of morphological variation and shows that adaptive differentiation may be maintained despite the homogenizing influence of gene flow. Generally, the morphologically variable populations of A. oculatus are seen to be poor candidates for in situ speciation, but an exceptional case on the west coast of Dominica indicates that isolation resulting from vicariant events may lead to rapid differentiation at both mitochondrial and nuclear loci. This provides a possible mechanism for anole speciation on other Caribbean islands.},

	Abstract = {Behavioral interaction during social situations is a continuum of action, response, and reaction. The temporal nature of social interaction creates a series of stressful situations, such as aggression, displacement from resources, and the variable psychological challenge of adapting to dynamic social hierarchies. The ebb and flow of neurochemical and endocrine secretions during social stress provide a unique tool for understanding individualized responses to stress. Each social station is an adaptive response to a stressful social condition, resulting in unique neuroendocrine and behavioral responses. By examining the temporal changes of limbic monoamines and plasma glucocorticoids, aspects of mechanisms for adaptation emerge. The similarity of temporal patterns induced by social stress among fish, reptiles and primates are remarkable. Even different specific coping mechanisms point out the similarity of vertebrate stress responses. The lizard Anolis carolinensis exhibits a unique sign stimulus generated during social stress by the sympathetic nervous system that serves as a temporal landmark to distinguish neuroendocrine patterns. During social interaction dominant males have a shorter latency to eyespot darkening than opponents, inhibiting aggressive display. Eyespot coloration can be delayed using a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, causing dominant social status in many animals to be lost. Reversal of social status via serotonergic activation appears to mimic chronic serotonergic activity. The pattern of eyespot darkening, faster in dominant males, is coincident with that for serotonergic activity. The fundamental temporal relationship between dominant and subordinate limbic monoaminergic activity over a continuous course of social interaction appears to be a two-phase response, temporally specific to brain region, and always faster in dominant individuals.},

A summary of the neural and endocrine causes and consequences of specific behavioral patterns seen in the small diurnal lizard, Anolis carolinensis, has provided a model for the exploration of the dynamics of autonomic and neurohormonal contributions to adaptive behavior. In this species, changes in body color provide indices of the flux of circulating stress-relevant hormones, and are seen in situations from spontaneous exploration through agonistic behavior. Furthermore, captive adult males spontaneously and consistently manifest social dominance relationships that provide many of the elements of a stress-mediated adaptive behavioral patterns. These patterns include suppressed reproduction and long-term coping apparently based more on stress-mediated changes in motivation than acquired changes in behavior.},

	Abstract = {Why convergent evolution occurs among some species occupying similar habitats but not among others is a question that has received surprisingly little attention. Caribbean Anolis lizards, known for their extensive convergent evolution among islands in the Greater Antilles, are an appropriate group with which to address this question. Despite the well-documented pattern of between-island convergence, some Greater Antillean anoles are not obviously part of the convergence syndrome. One example involves aquatic anoles--species that are found near to and readily enter streams-which have evolved independently twice in the Caribbean and also twice on mainland Central America. Despite being found in similar habitats, no previous study has investigated whether aquatic anoles represent yet another case of morphological convergence. We tested this hypothesis by collecting morphological data for seven aquatic anole species and 29 species from the six convergent types of Greater Antillean habitat specialists. We failed to find evidence for morphological convergence: the two Caribbean aquatic species are greatly dissimilar to each other and to the Central American species, which, however, may be convergent upon each other. We suggest two possible reasons for this lack of convergence in an otherwise highly convergent system: either there is more than one habitat type occupied by anoles in the proximity of water, or there is more than one way to adapt to a single aquatic habitat. We estimate that almost all of the 113 species of Greater Antillean anoles occupy habitats that are also used by distantly related species, but only 15% of these species are not morphologically similar to their distantly related ecological counterparts. Comparative data from other taxa would help enlighten the question of why the extent of convergence is so great in some lineages and not in others.},

	Abstract = {During the breeding season, male green anole lizards extend a throat fan (dewlap) in courtship. This behavior is facilitated by testosterone (T). Females extend a much smaller dewlap less often, even with the same dose of T. During the nonbreeding season when T is low, dewlap extension is reduced. To determine if parallels exist between structure and function, we investigated neuron soma size and density in the preoptic area (POA) and ventromedial nucleus of the amygdala (AMY), which are involved in the display behavior, in breeding and nonbreeding males and females. Cells from breeding animals were larger than cells from nonbreeding animals, but they were not sexually dimorphic. No significant effects existed in neuron density. This experiment indicates that portions of the anole forebrain important for sexual behavior are plastic and might be influenced by seasonal changes in steroid hormones. To investigate whether T can reverse the seasonal difference in soma size in both sexes, gonadectomized nonbreeding anoles were implanted with an empty or T propionate-filled capsule; animals were also tested for male-typical courtship behavior. Males and females treated with T had higher rates of dewlap extension, but across treatment groups these rates were greater in males. Neuron soma size in the POA and AMY was larger in males than females, but no effects of treatment were detected. Taken together, the results indicate that T can stimulate behavior in the nonbreeding season and suggest that a dissociation exists between the regulation of the courtship display and soma size of relevant brain regions.},

	Abstract = {During courtship and aggression, adult male green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) extend a large red throat fan called a dewlap. Adult females have a very small dewlap; they rarely use it during agonistic encounters and never during courtship. The motoneurons, nerve, muscle fibers, neuromuscular junctions, and cartilage pieces responsible for dewlap extension are all larger in adult males than females, parallel to the behavioral dimorphisms. However, the general developmental pattern of these structures, and when they become sexually dimorphic, was largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the length of the 2nd ceratobranchial cartilages (which unfold the dewlap), muscle fiber size, nerve cross-sectional area, and motoneuron soma size, as well as measures of body size (snout-vent length and body weight) at post-hatching days 1, 30, 60, 75, and 90. All measures other than motoneuron soma size increased over time. However, only cartilage length and muscle fiber size became sexually dimorphic in the first three months after hatching. The cartilage was greater in males than females by d60, and muscle fiber size differentiated by d75. The results indicate that peripheral structures involved in dewlap extension differentiate prior to those in the brain and thus, because males and females in this age range are identical in size, dewlap (cartilage) size could be a relatively specific factor contributing to the sexual differentiation of the rest of the neuromuscular system.},

	Abstract = {In the tropical lizard Anolis pulchellus vitellogenin (Vtg), the plasma precursor of egg-yolk proteins, consists of a family of five polypeptides ranging between 116 and 226 kDa. In addition, lipovitellin-LV1, the main yolk protein, resolves electrophoretically into several forms. This suggests that yolk LV1 is a mixture of similar but distinct peptides that presumably correspond to the LV1 domains of the plasma Vtgs. Here, we test the hypothesis that each component of yolk LV1 is distinct enough to be antigenically different and that these components correspond to cleavage products of plasma Vtg polypeptides. Our experimental approach is based on adsorptions of a polyclonal antiserum against purified LV1 with membrane-immobilized Vtgs. This immunochemical design permitted us to dissect sub-populations of LV1 antibodies that specifically reacted with one of the plasma Vtgs. The presence of unique epitopes in the LV1 components directly indicates differences among the structures of their plasma Vtg precursors and supports the idea of a heterogeneous multigene Vtg family in Anolis. These results also show the potential of this immunoadsorption approach for the identification, and even separation of proteins sharing a high degree of similarity in their molecular structures.},

	Abstract = {We describe morphological variation (scalation and coloration) observed among eight individuals of the Panamanian lizard species Anolis casildae. This variation was not observed in the holotype and aids in identification of this recently described species (originally described on the basis of a single, male specimen). This species occurs only in the Reserva Forestal Fortuna (Chiriqui Province) and the adjacent Bosque Protector Palo Seco (Bocas del Toro Province) in western Panama. Anolis casildae can be distinguished from all other Panamanian anole species via six features: (1) two enlarged superciliary scales (the first larger than the second); (2) an anterior nasal scale in contact with the rostral scale or separated from the rostral by one scale; (3) 6-8 sublabial scales to the center of the eye; (4) 3-4 scales between the supraobital semicircles; (5) unique coloration (4-6 oblique brown bands interspersed by blue-outlined yellow patches; dewlap is a dirty cream color with broad yellow scale rows irregularly interspersed with smaller emerald green scales) and (6) A. casildae occurs from 1,050 to 1,400 m in the Cordillera Central. We also compare our natural history observations of A. casildae to a similar large anole, A. frenatus, a species which we believe A. casildae to be closely related.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of phylogenetic analyses of 1447 bases of mitochondrial DNA sequence for 21 populations representing seven species of the Anolis grahami series (A. conspersus, A. garmani, A. grahami, A. lineatopus, A. opalinus, A. reconditus, and A. valencienni), six of which occur on Jamaica. These data include 705 characters that are phylogenetically informative according to parsimony. A parsimony analysis of these data combined with previously published allozymic data yields a single most parsimonious tree with strong support for monophyly of the A. grahami series, the sister-group relationship between Anolis lineatopus and A. reconditus and a clade composed of Anolis garmani, A. grahami, and A. opalinus. Based on DNA data alone, A. conspersus is nested within A. grahami. Haplotypes sampled from geographic populations of A. grahami, A. lineatopus, and A. opalinus are highly divergent (approximately 12-15% sequence difference on average for each species) and show similar phylogeographic patterns, suggesting that each of these currently recognized species may be a complex of species. Anolis valencienni also shows high sequence divergence among haplotypes from different geographic populations (approximately 8% sequence difference) and may contain cryptic species. Divergence among haplotypes within A. garmani is substantially lower (approximately 3% sequence difference), and phylogeographic patterns are significantly different from those observed in A. grahami, A. lineatopus and A. opalinus.},

	Abstract = {Performance studies have long been a cornerstone of evolutionary studies of adaptation because of their purported importance for fitness. Nevertheless, for most systems, the mechanistic link among habitat use, morphology and performance is poorly understood. Further, few studies consider how behavior affects the relationship between morphology and performance. Here, I highlight the utility of considering both of these neglected areas by discussing studies in two systems: (1) the evolution of habitat use in Caribbean Anolis lizards, and (2) the evolution of limb function in desert lizards. Caribbean Anolis lizards partition the habitat via selection of different perch diameters, and surface diameter also exerts a strong effect on locomotor performance. Phylogenetic analyses show that Anolis species tend to avoid using perches in which their performance is submaximal, and also show that species with large performance breadths use a greater range of habitats. The underlying basis of this performance to habitat use link is a trade-off between the ability to sprint quickly on broad surfaces and the ability to move effectively on narrow surfaces. Studies of the kinematics of high-speed locomotion in five morphologically distinct lizard species reveal that some species exhibited behaviors that greatly enhanced their performance abilities relative to other species, suggesting that behavior can play a key role in the link between morphology and performance. Overall, these findings underscore the value of using a mechanistic approach for studying the links between habitat use, morphology and behavior.},

	Abstract = {Fine-level taxon discrimination is important in biodiversity assessment and ecogeographical research. Genomic markers are often required for studies on closely related taxa, however, most existing mitochondrial and nuclear markers require prior knowledge of the genome and are impractical for use in small conservation projects. This study describes the application of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) to discriminate at four progressively finer evolutionary levels of Caribbean Anolis lizards from the central Lesser Antilles. AFLP is shown to be a rapid and effective method for discriminating between species. Separation increases with primer pair number and choice of primer combination appears to be noncritical. Initial population-level results show markedly less discriminatory power. A screening technique for the identification of population informative markers combining principal component and principal coordinate analyses is presented and assessed. Subsequent results show selected conspecific AFLP data to be remarkably congruent with those of mitochondrial DNA, microsatellite and morphological markers. The use of AFLP as a low-cost nuclear marker in species-level taxon discrimination is supported, whereas population level application demands further consideration.},

	Abstract = {We report microspectrophotometric (MSP) data for the visual pigments and oil droplets of 17 species of Caribbean anoline lizard known to live in differing photic habitats and having distinctly different dewlap colors. The outgroup Polychrus marmoratus was also examined to gain insight into the ancestral condition. Except for Anolis carolinensis, which is known to use vitamin A(2) as its visual pigment chromophore, all anoline species examined possessed at least four vitamin-A(1)-based visual pigments with maximum absorbance (lambda(max)) at 564, 495, 455 and 365 nm. To the previously reported visual pigments for A. carolinensis we add an ultraviolet-sensitive one with lambda(max) at 365 nm. Five common classes of oil droplet were measured, named according to apparent color and associated with specific cone classes - yellow and green in long-wavelength-sensitive (LWS) cones, green only in medium-wavelength-sensitive (MWS) cones and colorless in short-wavelength-sensitive (SWS) and ultraviolet-sensitive (UVS) cones. MSP data showed that the colorless droplet in the SWS cone had significant absorption between 350 and 400 nm, while the colorless droplet in the UVS cone did not. The pattern for Polychrus marmoratus was identical to that for the anoles except for the presence of a previously undescribed visual cell with a rod-like outer segment, a visual pigment with a lambda(max) of 497 nm and a colorless oil droplet like that in the UVS cones. These findings suggest that anoline visual pigments, as far as they determine visual system spectral sensitivity, are not necessarily adapted to the photic environment or to the color of significant visual targets (e.g. dewlaps).},

	Abstract = {Male courtship and copulation are androgen dependent in the green anole lizard, and female receptivity can be facilitated by testosterone. However, only a few, and relatively large, regions in the brain have been implicated in the control of these behaviours. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were therefore used to determine in detail where androgens are likely to act in the brains of breeding males and females. A 697-bp fragment of the anole androgen receptor (AR) was cloned from total RNA isolated from the kidney, which contains the highly androgen-sensitive renal sex segment. The cloned fragment spanned part of the C, the entire D, and part of the E domains, and shared a high degree of similarity with the AR of various species. 35S-labelled antisense and sense probes were generated from the 697-bp fragment for use in in situ hybridization, and the AR antibody PG-21 was used for immunohistochemistry. Both sexes consistently had AR mRNA expression and immunoreactivity in areas associated with vertebrate reproductive behaviours and in motor areas of the brainstem. Interestingly, the PG-21 antibody produced labelling in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, including neuronal processes. The distribution of mRNA and immunoreactivity were comparable in males and females, and the amount of labelling was generally similar, although slightly greater in females. The expression pattern of AR in this species supports the idea that distribution is highly conserved among vertebrates, but that it probably does not dictate behavioural differences between the sexes in anoles.},

	Abstract = {Terrestrial habitats exhibit a variety of light environments. If species exhibit evolutionary adaptations of their visual system or signals to habitat light conditions, then these conditions can directly influence the structure of communities. We evaluated habitat light characteristics and visual-signal design in a pair of sympatric species of lizards: Anolis cooki and Anolis cristatellus. We found that each species occupies a distinct microhabitat with respect to light intensity and spectral quality. We measured the relative retinal spectral sensitivity and found significant differences between the species that correlate with differences in habitat spectral quality. We measured the spectral reflectance of the dewlaps (colourful throat fans used in communication), and found that the A. cooki dewlap reflects little ultraviolet (UV), while that of A. cristatellus reflects strongly in the UV. For both species downwelling light (irradiance) is rich in UV. However the background light (radiance) is rich in UV for A. cooki, but low in UV for A. cristatellus. Thus, the dewlap of each species creates a high contrast with the background in the UV. Our findings strongly suggest that these two species are partitioning their habitat through specializations of the visual system and signal design to microhabitat light conditions.},

	Abstract = {We present a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype phylogeny for Amazonian Anolis lizards, including geographical sampling within four species distributed across the Amazon basin (A. fuscoauratus, A. nitens, A. ortonii and A. punctatus). Approximately 1500 bp of mtDNA encoding ND2, COI and four transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are reported for 39 specimens representing four to five populations of each widespread species, plus eight outgroups. These new sequences are aligned with eight previously published sequences, yielding 914 variable characters and 780 parsimony-informative characters. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood reject the hypothesis that Amazonian anoles form a monophyletic group excluding Central American and Caribbean anoles, and suggest multiple faunal exchanges among these regions. Haplotype divergence among geographical populations of A. nitens, whose variation was influential in formulating the Pleistocene refuge hypothesis of Amazonian speciation, is very large (13-22% sequence difference), suggesting that these populations separated well before the Pleistocene. Haplotype divergences among geographical populations of A. fuscoauratus (3-4%), A. punctatus (4-9%) and A. ortonii (6-8%) also indicate pre-Pleistocene differentiation within each species, but temporally incongruent patterns among species.},

	Abstract = {Lizards of the genus Anolis extend and retract a large and often brightly colored throat fan called a dewlap. The dewlap in most anoles is a sexually dimorphic structure. It is larger in males than females and males use the dewlap more frequently and in more contexts than do females. In the present study we investigated whether plasma testosterone (T) levels and season affect the frequency of dewlap use in male--male interactions in the brown anole, Anolis sagrei. We manipulated plasma T levels by implanting adult, castrated males with pellets that delivered no T, a moderate dose of T, or a high dose of T. In tests with stimulus males, castrated males that were treated with a moderate or with a high dose of T had a significantly higher frequency of dewlap extensions than did castrated males that received no T. However, the frequency of dewlap extensions in castrated males that received the high dose of T did not differ significantly from castrated males that received the moderate dose of T or from non-castrated control males. Males captured during the breeding season and tested in the laboratory had a significantly higher frequency of dewlap extensions than did males captured in the postbreeding season and tested in the same manner. These results suggest that plasma T levels affect how frequently males of A. sagrei extend their dewlaps in male--male interactions and that seasonal changes in male dewlap use may be due to seasonal differences in plasma T levels.},

	Abstract = {Populations of the lizards Anolis carolinensis and A. sagrei were experimentally introduced onto small islands in the Bahamas. Less than 15 years after introduction, we investigated whether the populations had diverged and, if so, whether differentiation was related to island vegetational characteristics or propagule size. No effect of founding population size was evident, but differentiation of A. sagrei appears to have been adaptive, a direct relationship existed between how vegetationally different an experimental island was from the source island and how much the experimental population on that island had diverged morphologically. Populations of A. carolinensis had also diverged, but were too few for quantitative comparisons. A parallel exists between the divergence of experimental populations of A. sagrei and the adaptive radiation of Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles; in both cases, relative hindlimb length and perch diameter are strongly correlated. This differentiation could have resulted from genetic change or environmentally-driven phenotypic plasticity. Laboratory studies on A. sagrei from a population in Florida indicate that hindlimb length exhibits adaptive phenotypic plasticity. Further studies are required to determine if the observed differences among the experimental populations are the result of such plasticity. Regardless of whether the differences result from plasticity, genetic change, or both, the observation that anole populations differentiate rapidly and adaptively when exposed to novel environmental conditions has important implications for understanding the adaptive radiation of Caribbean anoles.},

@article{Higham:2001aa,
	Abstract = {Although the maximal speeds of straight-ahead running are well-documented for many species of Anolis and other lizards, no previous study has experimentally determined the effects of turning on the locomotor performance of a lizard. Anolis lizards are a diverse group of arboreal species, and the discrete paths created by networks of perches in arboreal environments often force animals to turn in their natural habitats. For three species of Anolis with similar overall body size but different shape, we quantified the escape locomotor performance for arboreal locomotion on 4.8 cm diameter perches that were straight (0 degrees ) or had turning angles of 30 degrees and 90 degrees. The turning angle had widespread significant effects that were often species-dependent. This was shown by measuring the average gross velocity (including the times while the lizards paused) of the three species covering the middle 30 cm of a racetrack with either 30 degrees or 90 degrees turns. The results were expressed as a percentage of the gross velocity over the same distance on a straight racetrack. The values obtained for A. grahami (99 % for 30 degrees turns and 79 % for 90 degrees turns) showed a smaller effect of turning angle than for A. lineatopus (79 % for 30 degrees turns and 50 % for 90 degrees turns) and A. valencienni (74 % for 30 degrees turns and 48 % for 90 degrees turns). Consequently, the rank order of species based on speed depended on the angle of the turn. Some of the magnitudes of decreased locomotor speed associated with turning exceeded those reported previously for the effects of decreasing perch diameter for these species. For all species, more pausing occurred with increased turning angle, with the twig ecomorph (A. valencienni) pausing the most. Approximately half the individuals of each species jumped to traverse the 90 degrees turn, but some of the potential benefits of jumping for increasing speed were offset by pauses associated with preparing to jump or recovering balance immediately after a jump. The tail of Anolis lizards may facilitate the substantial rotation (>60 degrees ) of the body that often occurred in the airborne phase of the jumps.},

	Abstract = {Sexual dimorphisms in neuromuscular systems have been investigated in several vertebrate groups, but data on reptiles are limited. The present studies were designed to establish the copulatory neuromuscular system of the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis) as an appropriate model. Like mammals, male reptiles have copulatory organs. However, each individual has two "hemipenes" that are controlled by bilateral sets of muscles. First, the anatomy of the hemipenes and associated muscles was described in males and the same anatomical region examined in females. Second, spinal motoneurons innervating one of these muscles, the transversus penis (TPN), were localized by using the retrograde tracer biocytin. They were detected in the last trunk and first sacral segments (T17-S1). Third, motoneuron number and soma size were assessed in Nissl-stained sections of spinal cord segments T17-S1 of breeding males and females. Male-biased sexual dimorphisms were detected in both measures, but the motoneurons innervating a tail muscle, the caudifemoralis (CF), are also located in the same region of cord. Therefore, in the last study, the CF was injected with biocytin in both sexes to eliminate its motoneurons from the analysis and gain a more accurate representation of the TPN motoneuron pool. An equivalent number of CF motoneurons were labeled in both sexes, and the results from the previous study were replicated. Thus, similar to other vertebrate models, parallels between morphology and function exist in the green anole copulatory system. Future investigations will broaden the comparative perspective on mechanisms regulating sexual dimorphisms relating to reproductive behaviors in vertebrates.},

	Abstract = {Internal fertilization and oviparity most likely are symplesiomorphies for modern reptiles, and viviparity has evolved independently numerous times in Sauria and Serpentes. Oviducal sperm storage is known in females of all taxa except Amphisbaenia. However, in Rhynchocephalia and Crocodilia, sperm storage is poorly studied, and specialized sperm storage tubules (Ssts) are unknown. We use the molecular phylogenetic hypothesis [(Chelonia+Archosauria) (Squamata)] to trace evolution of sperm storage characters. Ssts arose independently in Chelonia and Squamata. Turtles possess albumen-secreting glands in the anterior half of the oviduct (the tuba or isthmus), and the most distal of these glands also serve as Ssts; in addition, some turtles possess Ssts in the adjacent segment of the oviduct, the uterus. Squamates lack albumen-secreting glands, and the ancestral state is possession of Ssts in the posterior infundibulum (uterine tube). Secondarily, iguanids have evolved vaginal Ssts. In this paper, we present the first ultrastructural observations on vaginal Ssts in lizards, using Anolis sagrei (Polychrotidae). Proximally, the neck of these simple tubular glands continues the alternation of ciliated and secretory cells lining the lumen of the vagina. However, the epithelial cells of the distal sperm storage area are neither secretory nor ciliated. The Ssts of Anolis are more similar to those of birds more than to infundibular receptacles in snakes and lizards.},

@article{OBryant:2002ab,
	Abstract = {The green anole lizard exhibits seasonal courtship behavior that is sexually dimorphic. This courtship consists of the extension of a bright red throat fan (dewlap) associated with head-bobbing display behavior. While males extend their dewlaps in aggressive encounters as well as in courtship, females use their considerably smaller dewlaps much less frequently and mainly in agonistic encounters. In parallel, a number of components of the neuromuscular system controlling dewlap extension are greater in males than in females during the breeding season, including dewlap motoneuron soma size and muscle fiber size and number. These features do not seem to change substantially in adulthood, despite a dramatic decline in dewlap use during the nonbreeding season. We explored the morphology of this neuromuscular system in more detail in the present experiment in males and females during both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons. Fiber and whole muscle length (approximately perpendicular to the fibers) were measured. Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry was used to visualize neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), and the surface area and density of NMJs were assessed for each animal. During the breeding season, NMJ size was larger in males than in females, but NMJ density along each fiber was equivalent between the sexes. In addition, whole muscle length and that of individual muscle fibers, was larger in males than in females. However, when corrected for body size, the sex difference in muscle fiber length disappeared. In the nonbreeding season, the sexual dimorphisms were maintained, suggesting that these features do not change substantially due to differences in circulating testosterone or a difference in use across seasons. Overall, these results are consistent with the idea that enhanced NMJ size is a relatively stable feature of the dewlap muscle in adulthood that either facilitates or is a consequence of using a larger muscle to extend a bigger dewlap in males compared to females.},

	Abstract = {A social sign stimulus that is sympathetically induced affects aggressive approaches and influences serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic activity in the brainstem nuclei of Anolis carolinensis. Darkening of postorbital skin via sympathetic activation of adrenal catecholamines and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors provides a visual signal that forms more rapidly in dominant than subordinate males during social interactions. This signal limits aggressive interactions. Males were painted postorbitally with green or black paint and then exposed to a mirror. Aggressive approaches to the mirror were inhibited in males viewing a reflection with darkened eyespots, and increased in males viewing a reflection without eyespots (hidden). Noradrenergic turnover in the raphe and locus ceruleus were greatest in test subjects that viewed a reflection with eyespots hidden by green paint. Perception of darkened eyespots stimulated greater serotonergic turnover in raphe, locus ceruleus and substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA). Dopaminergic turnover was higher in the raphe and SN/VTA of Anolis that viewed a reflection with darkened eyespots. However, these animals had lower dopamine turnover in the locus ceruleus than isolated and hidden eyespot groups. Of the possible roles of perikarya on central function and behavior, our results suggest feedback, cross-nuclear regulation, and some independence of function between nuclei and the forebrain terminal fields. Decreased serotonergic activity corresponds with increased aggression only in the raphe, suggesting that the raphe nuclei might be important for this behavioral trait. Increased serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic activities in SN/VTA in Anolis that view a reflected opponent with dark eyespots suggests that the SN/VTA might be directly involved in recognition of this social sign stimulus and the resulting inhibition of aggression.},

Before the hurricane, an island's area was a better predictor of the occurrence of A. sagrei than was its altitude. Immediately after, altitude was a better predictor: Apparently all lizards on islands lower than about 3 meters maximum elevation perished in the storm surge. After about 1 year, area again became the better predictor. By 19 months after the hurricane, A. sagrei populations occurred on 88% of the islands they formerly occupied. Recovery occurred via overwater colonization and propagation from eggs that survived inundation, mechanisms that were enhanced by larger island area. Thus, natural processes first destroyed and then quickly restored a highly regular species-area distribution.},

	Abstract = {Sex steroids of presumably maternal origin have been found in avian, crocodilian, and chelonian egg yolks, and they can affect offspring morphology and behavior. The present study reports testosterone (T) levels to which embryos are potentially exposed in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), a lizard with genotypic sex determination. We documented plasma and yolk T concentrations in adult females, in their developing follicles and eggs, and in freshly oviposited and incubating eggs. Plasma T was higher in reproductively active than in reproductively inactive females. Within reproductively active females, those with a single, large yolking follicle had higher plasma T than those that had one or more shelling, oviductal eggs. Individual females contributed different amounts of T to their yolks, but within females, more mature follicles or eggs consistently had higher yolk T concentrations than did less mature follicles or eggs. Similar to previous research, yolk T concentrations at oviposition were higher in male eggs than in female eggs. However, T levels during incubation did not differ by embryo sex, but rather increased in both male and female eggs. These results suggest that T plays a role in the reproductive physiology of females and potentially in the phenotypic development of their offspring. Furthermore, whereas the yolk T increase observed during follicular maturation is clearly a maternal influence, it remains unclear whether that observed during egg development (i.e., postfertilization) results from a lack of T uptake by the embryo as yolk is absorbed, from embryonic production of T that diffuses into the yolk, or from some combination of these processes. Because lizard embryos are comparatively well developed at oviposition, the assumption that yolk steroids are strictly of maternal origin may require modification, and the possibility that embryos are modulating their own steroid environment needs to be explored.},

@article{Summers:2001aa,
	Abstract = {Dominant and subordinate males produce neuroendocrine stress responses during aggressive social interaction. In addition, stress responsiveness has both acute and chronic temporal components. A neurochemical marker that distinguishes social status and aggression by temporal and regional differentiation is the activity of serotonergic nuclei and terminals. A unique model for distinguishing the relationships among the neuroendocrine machinery of stress, social status and behavior is the lizard Anolis carolinensis. Dominant males exhibit more aggression and have temporally advanced serotonergic responses. Chronic serotonergic activity is associated with subordinate social status and reduced aggression. Acute and chronic serotonergic responses occur in both dominant and subordinate males, and are distinguished temporally. This provides a fundamental question that may elucidate basic differences in behavior: What causes temporally advanced serotonergic activity in response to stress in dominant males? Secondarily, what is the neural basis for the acute and chronic responses? The neural mechanisms for transduction of the relevant behavioral signals are very plastic. Behavioral experience and visual stimuli can produce very rapid responses. Faster and greater responsiveness may be stimulated by restraint stress, social stress and the absence of social sign stimuli (e.g. eyespots of the lizard Anolis carolinensis). Stress response machinery provides regulatory factors necessary to modify social behavior, and to adapt it for specific contexts. Serotonergic activity is rapidly modified by glucocorticoids and GABA, and also by CRF under conditions of previous stress or in combination with AVP. Advancing acute elevation of serotonergic activity may be a distinguishing characteristic of dominant males. Social events add contextual conditioning to brain transmitter activity, with social information processed in a distributed fashion. Medial amygdala manifests delayed serotonergic response compared to hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, and is therefore a good candidate to mediate chronic stress responsiveness. Limiting or delaying acute effects, in addition to chronic serotonergic activity, may be the distinguishing characteristics of subordinate males. Monoamines, glucocorticoids, testosterone, CRF, AVP, AVT, play neuromodulatory roles producing context appropriate behavior.},

	Abstract = {Measures of serotonin (5-HT) turnover in A. carolinensis forebrain increase acutely when males exhibit dominant social/territorial display routines, but decrease during submissive displays [Baxter et al., 2001a, b]. The present investigation sought to determine whether a difference in presynaptic regulatory receptors - one that might affect 5-HT flux - distinguish dominant vs. submissive anoles. Both 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(1D) receptors are presynaptic regulators of output; this role is prominent at 5-HT terminals, where stimulation inhibits 5-HT release. Here, 3H-sumatriptan binding at sites similar to mammalian 5-HT(1B/D) receptors was significantly higher in forebrain regions of submissive anoles than in dominant cagemates; this receptor site seemed pharmacologically more like a 5-HT(1B) than a 5-HT(1D) receptor. Higher densities of presynaptic 5-HT(1B) receptors in subordinates than in dominants might account for differences in 5-HT flux (lower in subordinates than in dominants) observed in displaying anoles of different status. Knockout mice missing the 5-HT(1B) receptor show heightened male territorial aggressiveness, thus similar 5-HT regulatory mechanisms might influence the likelihood of dominance in both mammals and reptiles.},

	Abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) functions are associated with social dominance status in diverse species, but to date the brain regions wherein 5-HT exerts such effects are uncertain. Here, we indexed 5-HT turnover in male Anolis carolinensis as the ratio of 5-HT to its metabolite, 5-hydroxy-indol-acetic acid, and also as the accumulation of the in vivo tracer 14C-alpha-methyl-tryptophan (14C-AMT). After patching one eye, displaying dominant animals increased both measures of 5-HT turnover in the forebrain hemisphere receiving display-evocative visual stimuli, compared to control, contralateral brain, whereas both 5-HT turnover indices were decreased when animals displayed submissively. In contrast, various non-displaying controls showed forebrain symmetry on both measures. Drugs that stimulate 5-HT(2C) receptors in mammals, and have 5-HT(2C)-like binding in A. carolinensis, evoked some elements of dominant display behaviors in non-dominant anole males and also activated dorsolateral basal ganglia as seen in non-medicated dominants when they display [Baxter et al., 2001]. Thus, acute changes in forebrain 5-HT output from baseline equilibrium, acting at 5-HT(2C)-like receptors, might effect some elements of the dominant vs. submissive male anoles' territorial displays. A mechanistic model of how this might occur is offered. Given similarities in 5-HT systems, forebrain functions, and territorial display routines, similar mechanisms might have similar functions in other amniotes, including primates.},

	Abstract = {Ritualistic displays of aggressive intent are important social signals, often obviating physically dangerous engagement. To date, however, brain regions mediating such behaviors are not established. Here we used male Anolis carolinensis together with an in vivo 14C-2-deoxyglucose method to determine patterns of brain activation during elicitation of this animal's dominance displays vs. other behaviors. By patching one eye regional brain activation in the hemisphere receiving display-evocative visual stimuli ('seeing' side) was compared to activity in the contralateral brain that did not see specific stimuli ('patched' side); this was quantitated as the ratio of seeing/patched activity for brain regions of interest. Lone males displaying dominantly to mirrors activated dorsolateral basal ganglia (BG) in the seeing, compared to the patched hemisphere; this was not seen in various non-displaying controls. Degree of dorsolateral BG activation also correlated with a measure of dominant display activity, but not with locomotion. In socially stable pairs, displaying dominants showed similar activation of dorsolateral BG, but deactivated ventromedial BG; non-dominant cagemates displaying submissively had the opposite pattern. When cohabiting peacefully without displaying, paired dominants' and subordinates' brain activity patterns were similar to each other. Thus, different BG subsystems seem involved in dominant vs. submissive display behaviors. Given similarities in both social displays and BG organization, homologous brain systems might have similar functions in members of other amniote classes, including primates.},

We constructed these ancestral pigments by introducing the necessary mutations into contemporary pigments and evaluated their absorption spectra using an in vitro assay. The results show that the common ancestor of vertebrates and most other ancestors had LWS pigments. Multiple regression analyses of ancestral and contemporary MWS and LWS pigments show that single mutations S180A, H197Y, Y277F, T285A, A308S, and double mutations S180A/H197Y shift the lambda(max) of the pigments by -7, -28, -8, -15, -27, and 11 nm, respectively. It is most likely that this "five-sites" rule is the molecular basis of spectral tuning in the MWS and LWS pigments during vertebrate evolution.},

	Abstract = {Regurgitation by arthropods is often considered to be a rudimentary form of defense against predators. In phytophagous insects, regurgitate composition will vary with diet, and plant secondary compounds from host plants can contribute to the effectiveness of regurgitate deterrence. Regurgitation in response to predator attack is particularly common in grasshoppers. However, there is little empirical evidence in favor of grasshopper regurgitation as an effective antipredator mechanism in natural predator-prey systems. In particular, studies of the effect of grasshopper diet on regurgitate deterrence to vertebrate predators are lacking. This study investigated the relationship between diet and predator defense in the grasshopper, Schistocerca emarginata (=lineata) (Orthoptera: Acrididae). Using the insectivorous lizard, Anolis carolinensis (Iguanidae), as a predator, I demonstrate that consumption of Ptelea trifoliata (Rutaceae) by S. emarginata can confer distastefulness as well as toxicity. Regurgitate deterrence is mediated strictly by host plant material in the gut and does not require an enteric contribution from the grasshopper. Regurgitation by Ptelea-fed S. emarginata can result in rejection prior to ingestion by A. carolinensis and can enable grasshoppers to survive predator attacks.},

@article{Cope:2001aa,
	Abstract = {The green anole (Anolis carolinensis) is the most northerly distributed of its Neotropical genus. This lizard avoids a winter hibernation phase by the use of sun basking behaviors. Inevitably, this species is exposed to high doses of ambient solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Increases in terrestrial ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation secondary to stratospheric ozone depletion and habitat perturbation potentially place this species at risk of UVR-induced immunosuppression. Daily exposure to subinflammatory UVR (8 kJ/m2/day UV-B, 85 kJ/m2/day ultraviolet A [UV-A]), 6 days per week for 4 weeks (total cumulative doses of 192 kJ/m2 UV-B, 2.04 x 10(3) kJ/m2 UV-A) did not suppress the anole's acute or delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to horseshoe crab hemocyanin. In comparison with the available literature UV-B doses as low as 0.1 and 15.9 kJ/m2 induced suppression of DTH responses in mice and humans, respectively. Exposure of anoles to UVR did not result in the inhibition of ex vivo splenocyte phagocytosis of fluorescein labeled Escherichia coli or ex vivo splenocyte nitric oxide production. Doses of UV-B ranging from 0.35 to 45 kJ/m2 have been reported to suppress murine splenic/peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis and nitric oxide production. These preliminary studies demonstrate the resistance of green anoles to UVR-induced immunosuppression. Methanol extracts of anole skin contained two peaks in the ultraviolet wavelength range that could be indicative of photoprotective substances. However, the resistance of green anoles to UVR is probably not completely attributable to absorption by UVR photoprotective substances in the skin but more likely results from a combination of other factors including absorption by the cutis and absorption and reflectance by various components of the dermis.},

	Abstract = {Species of malaria parasite (phylum Apicomplexa: genus Plasmodium) have traditionally been described using the similarity species concept (based primarily on differences in morphological or life-history characteristics). The biological species concept (reproductive isolation) and phylogenetic species concept (based on monophyly) have not been used before in defining species of Plasmodium. Plasmodium azurophilum, described from Anolis lizards in the eastern Caribbean, is actually a two-species cryptic complex. The parasites were studied from eight islands, from Puerto Rico in the north to Grenada in the south. Morphology of the two species is very similar (differences are indistinguishable to the eye), but one infects only erythrocytes and the other only white blood cells. Molecular data for the cytochrome b gene reveal that the two forms are reproductively isolated; distinct haplotypes are present on each island and are never shared between the erythrocyte-infecting and leucocyte-infecting species. Each forms a monophyletic lineage indicating that they diverged before becoming established in the anoles of the eastern Caribbean. This comparison of the similarity, biological and phylogenetic species concepts for malaria parasites reveals the limited value of using only similarity measures in defining protozoan species.},

	Abstract = {Anoline lizards communicate with visual displays in which they open and close a colourful throat fan called the dewlap. We used a visual fixation reflex as an assay to test the effects of stimulus versus background chromatic and brightness contrast on the probability of detecting a moving coloured (i.e. dewlap-like) stimulus in Anolis cristatellus. The probability of stimulus detection depended on two additive visual-system channels, one responding to brightness contrast and one responding to chromatic contrast, independent of brightness. The brightness channel was influenced only by wavelengths longer than 450nm and probably received input only from middle- and/or long-wavelength photoreceptors. The chromatic contrast channel appeared to receive input from three, or possibly four, different classes of cone in the anoline retina, including one with peak sensitivity in the ultraviolet. We developed a multi-linear regression equation that described most of the results of this study to a reasonable degree of accuracy. In the future, this equation could be used to predict the relative visibility of different-coloured stimuli in different habitat light conditions, which should be very useful for testing hypotheses that attempt to relate habitat light conditions and visual-system response to the evolution of signal design.},

@article{Rosen:2001aa,
	Abstract = {Courtship behavior in male green anoles is partly mediated by the 5alpha-reductase enzyme, which converts testosterone (T) to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone. This study aimed to determine whether the activity of 5alpha-reductase is enhanced in breeding males compared to females and nonbreeding males who do not normally display masculine behaviors. In some cases, aromatase, which converts T to 17beta-estradiol, also was assessed to determine whether the pattern of its activity in anoles is similar to that in other vertebrates. 5alpha-Reductase is greatest in the brainstem, so its activity was determined separately in homogenates of whole brain and brainstems. The following comparisons were done in different assays: (1) breeding males with breeding females, (2) nonbreeding males with nonbreeding females, and (3) breeding males with nonbreeding males. Aromatase activity was greater in breeding males (mean +/- SE, 0.61 +/- 0.06 fmol/min/mg protein) than in breeding females (0.41 +/- 0.08 fmol/min/mg protein). It was also greater in breeding males (0.84 +/- 0.16 fmol/min/mg protein) than in nonbreeding males (0.33 +/- 0.07 fmol/min/mg protein). In contrast, sex or seasonal differences did not exist in 5alpha-reductase activity. The results are consistent with those of other vertebrate species in which male-biased sex dimorphisms and seasonal differences occur in aromatase, but not in 5alpha-reductase activity. The greater levels of aromatase activity in breeding male anoles suggest that this enzyme might mediate male-specific functions. The equivalently high levels of 5alpha-reductase activity in both sexes suggests that, in addition to facilitating male courtship behavior, the enzyme has a basic function common to both sexes.},

	Abstract = {All autonomous non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons reported to date in vertebrates encode an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-like enzyme necessary for target sequence cleavage and subsequent target-primed reverse transcription. We describe here vertebrate non-LTR retrotransposons encoding another type of endonuclease more related to type IIS restriction enzymes. Such retrotransposons have been detected until now only in trypanosomes, nematodes, and arthropods. The retrotransposon Rex6 was identified in the genome of several teleost fish including Xiphophorus maculatus (platyfish), Oryzias latipes (medakafish), Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia), and Fugu rubripes (Japanese pufferfish). Rex6 encodes a reverse transcriptase and a putative restriction enzyme-like endonuclease and is a member of the R4 family of non-LTR retrotransposons containing the Dong and R4 elements found in nematodes and insects. Rex6 was active in many species during teleost evolution and underwent several bursts of retrotransposition (some of them being relatively recent) leading to a high copy number of Rex6 in the genome of numerous fish. Extremely truncated Rex6-related sequences were detected by database screening in reptiles, including the snake Trimeresus flavoviridis and the lizard Anolis carolinensis, but not in sequences from the human genome project, suggesting that this element might have been lost from certain vertebrate lineages.},

	Abstract = {A close relationship between morphology and habitat is well documented for anoline lizards. To test the generality of this relationship in lizards, snout-vent, tail, and limb lengths of 18 species of Tropidurus (Tropiduridae) were measured and comparisons made between body proportions and substrate usage. Phylogenetic analysis of covariance by computer simulation suggests that the three species inhabiting sandy soils have relatively longer feet than do other species. Phylogenetic ANCOVA also demonstrates that the three species inhabiting tree canopies and locomoting on small branches have short tails and hind limbs. These three species constitute a single subclade within the overall Tropidurus phylogeny and analyses with independent contrasts indicate that divergence in relative tail and hind limb length has been rapid since they split from their sister clade. Being restricted to a single subclade, the difference in body proportions could logically be interpreted as either an adaptation to the clade's lifestyle or simply a nonadaptive synapomorphy for this lineage. Nevertheless, previous comparative studies of another clade of lizards (Anolis) as well as experimental studies of Sceloporus lizards sprinting on rods of different diameters support the adaptive interpretation.},

	Abstract = {Most studies on chitinase activity in lizards have been concerned with Palaearctic (European) and Laurasian (Middle Eastern and Asian) taxa. Several genera of Old World lizards, Anguis, Uromastix, Chamaeleo and Lacerta, have been shown to possess chitinolytic activity. To date, only one New World lizard, Anolis carolinensis, has been reported to exhibit chitinolytic activity. In the present study, chitinase activity was characterized in a second New World taxon, Sceloporus undulatus garmani, a New World, phrynosomatid lizard. Chitinolytic activity was measured by incubating tissue extracts with a radioactive chitin substrate, acetyl-[H3]chitin and determining acid soluble radioactivity as an estimate for chitin hydrolysis. Chitinolytic activity was present in stomach, small intestine and pancreas extracts, with the stomach and pancreas having the highest specific activities. Chitinolytic activity was higher at pH 4.5 than at pH 7.5. The stomach chitinase is immunologically similar to the gastric chitinase previously described for rainbow trout. Western blot analysis showed anti-chitinase cross-reactivity in the extracts of the stomach, but no cross-reactivity in the pancreatic or intestinal extracts, suggesting different isoforms of chitinase. There was no detected lysozyme activity (less than 0.01 mg/ml lysozyme) present in the extracts of the stomach, small intestine and pancreas. The localization of chitinolytic activity in S. u. garmani is in agreement with earlier reptilian reports on the distribution of chitinase.},

	Abstract = {Social stress from aggressive interaction is expressed differently in specific brain regions of dominant and subordinate male Anolis carolinensis. Prior to aggressive behavior, the outcome is predictable via the celerity of postorbital coloration: Dominant males exhibit more rapid eyespot darkening. Serotonergic activation is manifest rapidly (1 h) in hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and brainstem of subordinate males, and is expressed more rapidly in dominant males. Amygdalar serotonergic activation responds rapidly (1 h) in dominant males, but is expressed slowly (1 w) and chronically in subordinate males. We hypothesized that chronic (1 w) serotonin elevation, manipulated by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline, would decrease aggressiveness and result in subordinate status. Dominant status was established in pairs of male A. carolinensis. The pairs were separated and treated with sertraline or vehicle. Sertraline was given in food to either the dominant or the subordinate male, both males or neither male for 1 week. Pairs were reintroduced, and behavior and social status recorded. When both dominant and subordinate males were treated with sertraline (or vehicle), or when subordinate males alone were treated with sertraline, previously established social relationships remained unchanged or became associative. However, when dominant males alone were treated with sertraline, their social status was reversed (43%) or negated (57%). Latency to eyespot darkening was significantly retarded in dominant males treated with sertraline, and aggressive displays and attacks were reduced. Chronic 5-HT elevation is consistent with subordinate status. Social status and aggressive disposition do not appear to be immutable, but may be changed by neuroendocrine mechanisms that mediate adaptation to environmental conditions like stress.},

	Abstract = {We used in situ autoradiographic ligand binding methods to determine the occurrence and distribution of dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor sub-types in the anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. Both were present and exhibited pharmacological specificity characteristics similar to those described for mammals. However, unlike in mammals where in the neostriatum [outside the nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle complex (NA/OT)] these receptors exhibit only slight dorsolateral (D(2) high, D(1) low) to ventromedial (D(1 )high, D(2) low) gradients that co mingle extensively, in the anole striatum outside the NA/OT there was a striking laminar pattern, with little if any overlap between D(2) (high in a dorsal band) and D(1) (high ventral to the D(2) band) distributions. As D(1) receptors are related to the direct and D(2) to the indirect basal ganglia (BG) subsystems in mammals, we also determined anole striatal distributions of pre-proenkephalin mRNA, a marker for striatal efferents to the indirect BG subsystem in mammals. Here, too, there was a striking laminar pattern, with pre-proenkephalin mRNA in a band similar to that seen for D(2) receptors. The crisp neuroanatomical separation between these classic BG subsystem markers in Anolis striatum make this species attractive for the study of such systems' functions during behavior.},

	Abstract = {Serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors are thought to play important roles in the mammalian striatum. As basal ganglia functions in general are thought highly conserved among amniotes, we decided to use in situ autoradiographic methods to determine the occurrence and distribution of pharmacologically mammal-like 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors in the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, with particular attention to the striatum. We also determined the distributions of 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B/D), 5 HT(3), and 5-HT(uptake) receptors for comparison. All 5-HT receptors examined showed pharmacological binding specificity, and forebrain binding density distributions that resembled those reported for mammals. Anolis 5 HT(2A/C) and 5-HT(1A) site distributions were similar in both in vivo and ex vivo binding experiments. 5-HT(2A & C) receptors occur in both high and low affinity states, the former having preferential affinity for (125)I-(+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo-amphetamine hydrochloride ((125)I-DOI). In mammals (125)I-DOI binding shows a patchy density distribution in the striatum, being more dense in striosomes than in surrounding matrix. There was no evidence of any such patchy density of (125)I-DOI binding in the anole striatum, however. As a further indication that anoles do not possess a striosome and matrix striatal organization, neither (3)H-naloxone binding nor histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) were patchy. AChE did show a band-like striatal distribution, however, similar to that seen in birds.},

	Abstract = {This study addressed the role of testosterone (T) in the development of sexually dimorphic behavior in the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. We documented the pattern of endogenous T concentrations during ontogeny and we determined the behavioral effects of experimentally elevated T in juvenile males and females. T concentrations were measured in the plasma of hatchlings from eggs incubated in the laboratory, in juveniles of all sizes sampled in the field, and in the yolks of freshly laid eggs in the laboratory and were compared to plasma T in adult females (measured in this study) and adult males. There were no sex differences in plasma T in hatchling and small juvenile (<26-mm snout-vent length, SVL; <14 days old) males and females, concentrations of which in both sexes tended to decline over the 14-day posthatching period. Plasma T sharply increased in juvenile males, but not females, after approximately 14 days posthatching (>25-mm SVL), and it became significantly higher after approximately 38 days posthatching (>30-mm SVL). Plasma T for juvenile males was within the range detected in breeding adult females, but it was 20- to 45-fold lower than that of adult males, breeding or postbreeding. All eggs contained detectable yolk T, but eggs that gave rise to males contained nearly twice as much yolk T as those that gave rise to females. We do not know whether this yolk T comes from the mother, embryo, or both. In behavior trials conducted in the laboratory, juveniles (36- to 42-mm SVL) with T implants, regardless of whether they were male or female, had increased activity levels compared to juveniles with blank implants, due to increased rates of nearly every behavior monitored. These results are discussed in the context of the organization-activation theory of sexual differentiation and the particular life history of A. carolinensis.},

Crotaphytid sperm differ from those of polychrotids in several respects, including: the structure of the perforatorium, the size of the epinuclear electron-lucent region, aspects of the acrosome complex, the arrangement and structure of intermitochondrial dense bodies, and in the distance the fibrous sheath extends into the midpiece. The sperm of C. bicinctores, G. wislizenii, and A. carolinensis are most similar to those of the agamids and phrynosomatids examined to date. No spermatozoal autapomorphies for Crotaphytidae or Polychrotidae were found. The condition of having the intermitochondrial dense bodies arranged in regular incomplete rings is tentatively defined as a synapomorphy of Iguania (although modified in Chamaeleonidae).

All five fusion proteins displayed high affinity for E2 with dissociation constants (K(d)) ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 nM. Although, the fusion proteins exhibited similar binding preferences and binding affinities for many of the chemicals, several differences were observed. For example, alpha-zearalenol bound with greater affinity to GST-rtERdef than E2, which was in contrast to other GST-ERdef fusion proteins examined. Coumestrol, genistein and naringenin bound with higher affinity to the GST-aERdef, than to the other GST-ERdef fusion proteins. Many of the industrial chemicals examined preferentially bound to GST-rtERdef. Bisphenol A, 4-t-octylphenol and o,p' DDT bound with approximately a ten-fold greater affinity to GST-rtERdef than to other GST-ERdefs. Methoxychlor, p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDE, alpha-endosulfan and dieldrin weakly bound to the ERs from the human, mouse, chicken and green anole. In contrast, these compounds completely displaced [3H]E2 from GST-rtERdef. These results demonstrate that ERs from different species exhibit differential ligand preferences and relative binding affinities for estrogenic compounds and that these differences may be due to the variability in the amino acid sequence within their respective ER ligand binding domains.},

	Abstract = {The green anole, Anolis carolinensis, is the most thoroughly studied North American lizard species, yet little is known about the circadian system of this species. Studies in several lizard species, including Anolis, support the hypothesis that the pineal organ is the site of a major circadian pacemaker that controls the phasing and frequency of circadian clocks located elsewhere. We examined the effects of exogenous administration of the pineal hormone, melatonin, to determine if the pineal secretion of melatonin could be the mechanism whereby the pineal communicates with the rest of the circadian system in Anolis. Continuous melatonin administration via subcutaneous silastic implants to pineal-intact anoles exposed to light-dark (LD) cycles 6:18 and LD 6:20 and to pinealectomized anoles entrained to LD 6:18 completely suppressed activity that preceded lights-on suggesting a direct inhibitory (masking) effect on activity. Continuous exogenous administration of lower dosages of melatonin to anoles expressing their endogenous circadian activity rhythm (free-running) in dim continuous light caused either arrhythmicity, a shortening of the free-running period, bouts of arrhythmicity and rhythmicity, or a suppression of activity. It was concluded that melatonin can affect both the expression of the activity rhythm as well as the circadian oscillator driving the activity rhythm. The results support the hypothesis that the circadian pacemaker in the pineal organ controls other (subordinate) circadian clocks via the rhythmic synthesis and secretion of melatonin.},

	Abstract = {Large islands typically have more species than comparable smaller islands. Ecological theories, the most influential being the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, explain the species-area relationship as the outcome of the effect of area on immigration and extinction rates. However, these theories do not apply to taxa on land masses, including continents and large islands, that generate most of their species in situ. In this case, species-area relationships should be driven by higher speciation rates in larger areas, a theory that has never been quantitatively tested. Here we show that Anolis lizards on Caribbean islands meet several expectations of the evolutionary theory. Within-island speciation exceeds immigration as a source of new species on all islands larger than 3,000 km2, whereas speciation is rare on smaller islands. Above this threshold island size, the rate of species proliferation increases with island area, a process that results principally from the positive effects of area on speciation rate. Also as expected, the slope of the species-area relationship jumps sharply above the threshold. Although Anolis lizards have been present on large Caribbean islands for over 30 million years, there are indications that the current number of species still falls below the speciation-extinction equilibrium.},

	Abstract = {Darkening of postorbital skin in Anolis carolinensis occurs during stressful situations and is stimulated by sympathetic activation of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors via adrenal catecholamines. This eyespot forms more rapidly in dominant males during social interaction. Eyespot darkening (green to black) appears to function as a social signal communicating sympathetic activation and limiting aggressive interaction. To assess the value of the eyespot as a social signal, males were painted postorbitally with green, black, or red paint. Each male was exposed to a mirror following acclimation to the cage. The total number of aggressive displays toward the mirror image was greatest when eyespots were masked by green paint. In contrast, black or red artificial eyespots, regardless of size, inhibited biting behavior toward the mirror image. The most aggressive males, those who saw a reflected opponent with no eyespot (hidden with green paint), had significantly higher levels of all plasma catecholamines. These results suggest that A. carolinensis use information from the eyespot to assess their opponent's readiness to fight and thereby determine whether to be aggressive. Darkened eyespots are capable of inhibiting aggression, whereas aggressive displays from an opponent in the mirror without darkened eyespots do not. Darkened eyespots reflect rapid changes in plasma NE, DA, and Epi that may signal dominant social status.},

	Abstract = {I quantified the movement patterns of eight morphologically and ecologically diverse Caribbean Anolis lizard species in the field to address the following questions: (1) Do these eight species move at preferred speeds, and if so, what are these speeds? (2) What proportion of their maximum sprinting capacities do the anole species use when moving undisturbed? (3) What percentage of the time do lizards spend moving, and how far do they typically travel on a daily basis? (4) Have the preferred speeds of anoles coevolved with structural habitat use? Most of the distributions of speeds were highly skewed, with a preponderance of slow-speed locomotion (<20% of maximum capacity). Median speeds varied almost eightfold among species, from a low of 4.9 cm/s (3.0% of maximum) to a high of 38.0 cm/s (22.4% of maximum). For all eight species, at least 75% of their locomotor movements took place between 0% and 40% of maximum capacity. The eight species varied almost 15-fold in the percentage of time they spent moving, indicating that not all anole species are equally sedentary. Through usage of modern comparative methods, I showed that Anolis species that move slowly through their environments also tend to use narrow perch diameters and have large habitat breadths. These findings show how evolutionary approaches can be profitably integrated with physiological data to understand how species use their habitats.},

We raised hatchling A. sagrei in terraria provided with only broad or only narrow surfaces. At the end of the experiment, lizards in the broad treatment had relatively longer hindlimbs than lizards in the narrow treatment. These results indicate that not only is hindlimb length a plastic trait in these lizards, but that this plasticity leads to the production of phenotypes appropriate to particular environments. Comparison to hindlimb lengths of other Anolis species indicates that the range of plasticity is limited compared to the diversity shown throughout the anole radiation. Nonetheless, this plasticity potentially could have played an important role in the early stages of the Caribbean anole radiation.},

	Abstract = {Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is the evolutionary result of selection operating differently on the body sizes of males and females. Anolis lizard species of the Greater Antilles have been classified into ecomorph classes, largely on the basis of their structural habitat (perch height and diameter). We show that the major ecomorph classes differ in degree of SSD. At least two SSD classes are supported: high SSD (trunk-crown, trunk-ground) and low SSD (trunk, crown-giant, grass-bush, twig). Differences cannot be attributed to an allometric increase of SSD with body size or to a phylogenetic effect. A third explanation, that selective pressures on male and/or female body size vary among habitat types, is examined by evaluating expectations from the major relevant kinds of selective pressures. Although no one kind of selective pressure produces expectations consistent with all of the information, competition with respect to structural habitat and sexual selection pressures are more likely possibilities than competition with respect to prey size or optimal feeding pressures. The existence of habitat-specific sexual dimorphism suggests that adaptation of Anolis species to their environment is more complex than previously appreciated.},

	Abstract = {The larger islands of the Lesser Antilles are ecologically and geologically complex and are inhabited by single, but morphologically variable, Anolis species. Although earlier work has indicated that a large part of the morphological variation in Anolis oculatus from Dominica can be attributed to selection, a history of recurrent volcanic activity over the last few million years suggests that vicariance may have also played a significant role. We report a study of variation in the cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA across the island to address this issue. We uncovered a very high degree of polymorphism, with an overall gene diversity of 0.97 and a nucleotide diversity of 0.04. Sequences, on average, differ by 3.82% and the maximum pairwise divergence (corrected for multiple hits) is 9.29%. Most haplotypes are restricted to single localities (a pattern not changed by increasing the sample size). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of two distinct lineages on the island with strong phylogeographic structure. One of these is geographically restricted to a relatively small part of the central Caribbean coast. Sublineages were also discernible within the other more widely distributed lineage, but resolution within and support for these sublineages was poor. The phylogeographic pattern is not congruent with generalized body shape and scalation, but is significantly correlated with color pattern. Even when correcting for this lineage effect with partial Matrix correspondence tests, the relationship between color pattern and vegetation is reaffirmed, suggesting that although both vicariance and selection have played a role in the morphological differentiation of this species, selection for current environmental conditions has been more important. We discuss the causes of the phylogeographic structure in light of the volcanic history of the island and highlight the exceptional instance of congruence between all morphological character systems and lineage boundaries, which occurs at the transition between the northern and southern Caribbean ecotypes.},

	Abstract = {Both testosterone (T) and its metabolite, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), can facilitate male sexual behavior in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. The present study addresses the role of DHT synthesis in regulating male sexual behavior by inhibiting 5alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts T into DHT. In two separate experiments (one replacement and one maintenance paradigm), breeding adult males were castrated and implanted with capsules of T, DHT, or a control capsule (blank, BL). The animals were then injected with the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, FCE, or with steroid suspending vehicle (SSV) as a control. Both experiments produced similar results. Overall, T was most effective in eliciting courtship and copulatory behaviors above control levels. In both experiments, treatment with FCE attenuated the T-induced effects on courtship behavior, whereas the inhibition of 5alpha-reductase activity resulted in modest and inconsistent effects on the latency to intromission and the proportion of copulating males. DHT treatment did not significantly increase courtship or copulatory behaviors above control levels. These results suggest that (a) 5alpha-reductase activity is necessary but that DHT alone is not sufficient for stimulating courtship in male A. carolinensis; and (b) courtship behavior is more sensitive than copulatory behavior to the activity of the androgen metabolizing enzyme.},

	Abstract = {A visual social signal inhibiting aggression is coincident with limiting serotonergic and noradrenergic activity in subiculum, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, medial amygdala, but not lateral amygdala, septum, and hypothalamus. Darkening of postorbital skin in the lizard Anolis carolinensis is stimulated by sympathetic activation of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors via adrenal catecholamines, and occurs more rapidly in dominant males during social interaction. Eyespot darkening functions as a social signal limiting aggressive interaction. To assess the effect of this social signal on telencephalic activity of monoamines, males were painted postorbitally with green or black paint, and exposed to a mirror. Serotonergic and noradrenergic turnover, as estimated by ratios of catabolite to transmitter, were elevated in the subiculum, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and medial amygdala of animals in which the eyespots were masked by green paint. Conversely, dopaminergic activity in these brain regions was lower in males with hidden eyespots (painted green). Hiding the eyespot evoked significantly increased aggressive activity toward the mirror image. Furthermore, changes in monoaminergic turnover were coincident with altered aggressive behavior, suggesting a relationship between them. Changes of monoaminergic activity were not observed in the septum, lateral amygdala, or hypothalamus, when males with eyespots permanently marked (black) were compared with those with eyespots hidden (painted green). Stimulated (serotonergic and noradrenergic) or inhibited (dopaminergic) activity due to social signal and aggression are confined to regions of the brain similarly activated during social stress, and do not constitute a generalized activation of monoaminergic systems.},

	Abstract = {The prevalence of malaria parasites was studied in the lizard Anolis gundlachi over a 9-yr period at a site in the wet evergreen forest of eastern Puerto Rico. Three forms of the parasite infected the lizards; these were Plasmodium floridense, Plasmodium azurophilum in erythrocytes, and P. azurophilum in white blood cells. Overall prevalence of infection for 8 samples during the study period was significantly higher for males than females (32% of 3,296 males and 22% of 1,439 females). During the study, the site experienced substantial climatic and physical disturbance including rising temperature, droughts, and hurricanes that severely damaged the forest. Parasite prevalence in the first sample, 8 mo after the massive hurricane Hugo, was slightly, though significantly, lower than for subsequent samples. However, overall prevalence was stable during the 9-yr period. The results show malaria prevalence is more constant at the site than found for 2 studies in temperate forests, and that the Puerto Rico system may be an example of the stable, endemic malaria described by standard models for human malaria epidemiology.},

@article{Emerson:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Rapid activation of central serotonergic systems occurs in response to the social stress of aggression in dominant lizards. The most rapid expression of serotonergic activity occurs in nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and brainstem. To compare previously measured responses induced by social stressors with those provoked by physical stress, serotonergic activity was examined following restraint stress (handling) and forced physical exertion. After handling, some male Anolis carolinensis were placed on a race track and either run until there was no movement following 1 min of prodding, or half that time. Controls were killed without treatment. Lizards stressed by handling showed rapid (25 s) increases in serotonergic activity (5-HIAA/5-HT) in striatum, dorsal cortex, locus ceruleus, and nucleus accumbens. Other changes in serotonergic systems caused by stress occurred in raphe and hippocampus. Serotonergic changes induced by handling stress were reversed by exercise (to 50% maximal exertion time) in subiculum, striatum and nucleus accumbens. The serotonergic profile of lizards run until they would no longer respond to prodding (maximal exertion time) was significantly different from that for more acute exertion in hippocampus, subiculum, striatum, medial amygdala, locus ceruleus, area postrema, and raphe. Physical stress (handling) mimicked social stress by producing rapid serotonergic changes in hippocampus, subiculum, nucleus accumbens and locus ceruleus. In contrast, the medial amygdala, which has previously been demonstrated to respond serotonergically to social stress only after a temporal delay, did not show a rapid response to restraint stress.},

	Abstract = {We know little about how signals are used during territory establishment, particularly when potential competitors are separated by distances that are typical of those between neighbours. I studied the effects of residence time on the display behaviour of male Anolis sagrei lizards in long- and short-distance contexts. In the long-distance context, the habitat patches of two male lizards were 5 m apart, separating the males by a distance typical of that in territorial neighbourhoods. For the short-distance context, I placed two males in one habitat patch. In both contexts, either 1-day residents were paired with new arrivals, or both individuals were new arrivals. In the long-distance contexts only, I also created situations in which both individuals were 1-day residents. Residence time affected the relative frequencies of headbob displays ('bobbing displays' and 'nodding displays'). However, the direction of the effect depended on opponent proximity. In long-distance contexts, 1-day residents performed fewer bobbing displays relative to nodding displays than did new arrivals; in short-distance contexts 1-day residents performed more bobbing displays relative to nodding displays than did new arrivals. The results suggest that signalling during territory establishment is governed by a qualitatively different set of rules when potential competitors are at short versus long distances.

In the present study, we used the Golgi technique in an effort to characterize more completely the morphology of these dewlap motoneurons, and to investigate whether the dendritic arborization is different between the sexes. In addition to describing the morphology, we report that the length of processes, and numbers of primary processes and branch points are comparable in males and females.

The fusion proteins consisted of the D, E, and F domains of human (alpha), cloned reptilian (Anolis carolinensis) and recloned rainbow trout (Onchorhynkiss mykiss) estrogen receptors (ER) linked to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein. GST-hERalphadef (human), GST-aERdef (reptile) and GST-rtERdef (rainbow trout) fusion proteins exhibited high affinity for E2 with dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.4+/-0.1 nM, 0.7+/-0.2 nM, and 0.6+/-0.1 nM, respectively. Of the 44 PCBs examined, only PCBs 104, 184, and 188 effectively competed with [3H]E2 for binding to the GST-rtERdef protein with IC50 values ranging from 0.4-1.3 microM. In contrast, these same congeners only caused a 30% displacement of [3H]E2 in GST-hERalphadef and GST-aERdef proteins. Several additional congeners were found to bind to the GST-rtERdef fusion protein, although the degree of interaction varied among congeners. Among the HO-PCBs, 2',3',4',5'-tetrachloro-4-biphenylol and 2,6,2',6'-tetrachloro-4-biphenylol bound to all three fusion proteins with IC50 values ranging from 0.1-0.3 microM. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) concentrations of 20% significantly increased the ability of PCBs 104, 184, and 188 to compete with [3H]E2 for binding to the GST-ERdef fusion proteins, whereas at 20% DMSO, a significant reduction in saturable binding was observed. These results demonstrate that ERs from different species exhibit differential ligand preferences and relative binding affinities for PCBs, which can be dramatically affected by DMSO concentration.},

	Abstract = {The important role that competition plays in structuring communities is well documented; however, the role of competition in an evolutionary context remains unclear. Evolutionary investigations into the role of competition have often focused on the process of character displacement, and a good example of this is the evolution of body size in the Anolis lizards of the Caribbean islands. Previous work on the A. roquet species group has taken a phylogenetic approach and concluded that patterns of body size differences are not caused by character displacement but are a result of size assortment. Using a phylogenetic reconstruction based on the sequence of the cytochrome b gene (cyt-b) and ancestral character-state reconstruction methods, we investigated the roles of character displacement and size assortment. Our results indicated that size assortment alone was insufficient to explain the observed patterns of body size differences. Furthermore, we found that change in body size was associated with a change in allopatry/sympatry, thus supporting the character-displacement hypothesis. We conclude that patterns of body size differences in the A. roquet species group appear to be the result of a combination of character displacement and size assortment because character displacement was only found to be possible on three occasions.},

	Abstract = {Glucocorticoids secreted peripherally during stressful events act on central monoaminergic systems. In particular, serotonergic mediation of social behavior, such as aggression and reproduction, may be affected by glucocorticoids. This study was undertaken to determine if systemically administered corticosterone would rapidly affect central monoaminergic activity. Male Anolis carolinensis (N = 8 each group) were injected intraperitoneally with 10 or 100 micrograms corticosterone, 10 micrograms testosterone, or saline. Twenty minutes after treatment, brains were rapidly dissected and frozen and then microdissected (punch diameter 300 microm) and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Serotonergic turnover (estimated by 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/serotonin) in the hippocampus and medial amygdala was significantly enhanced by systemic corticosterone. Both of these regions of the brain have been associated with social stress. Testosterone also enhanced turnover in the hippocampus. The effect of corticosterone and testosterone may be to modulate socially induced differences in serotonergic response. Rapid, but short-lived, glucocorticoid stimulation of serotonin release suggests a possible mechanism for mediation of changing social behavioral events.},

@article{Lyons:1999aa,
	Abstract = {Secretion of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) from the melanotrophs of the neurointermediate lobe (NIL) of the lizard Anolis carolinensis was studied to investigate the role of membrane potential and extracellular calcium ions in the control of secretion in this species. MSH secretion was monitored from perifused NILs which had been in organ culture for 7-14 days prior to experiment to allow the nerve terminals present in the tissue to degenerate. Elevation of the K(+) concentration in the perifusate induced a marked increase in MSH secretion. Perifusion of the cultured NILs with a nominally Ca-free solution did not reduce basal MSH secretion but blocked K-induced secretion. Moreover, nimodipine, an antagonist of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, inhibited K-induced secretion, whereas BAY K 8644, a Ca(2+) channel agonist, potentiated it; but neither drug affected basal secretion. High inverted question markK(+) perifusate also stimulated MSH secretion from freshly excised (acute) NILs. Furthermore, in these preparations nominally Ca-free solution reduced basal secretion by 40% in addition to blocking K-induced secretion. As in the cultured NILs, nimodipine blocked and BAY K 8644 potentiated K-induced secretion in the acute NILs while not affecting basal secretion. The results from the cultured NILs are consistent with the hypothesis that stimulated MSH secretion from the melanotrophs of the anole is dependent upon Ca(2+) influx through voltage-gated calcium channels. The qualitatively similar results obtained from the acute NILs in response to high inverted question markK(+), nimodipine, and BAY K 8644 suggest that, for the most part, what is being observed are the direct effects of these substances on the melanotrophs. Basal secretion of MSH in cultured NILs is significantly less than that in the acute preparations. The calcium-sensitive fraction of basal secretion present in acute NILs may require the presence of nerve terminals.},

	Abstract = {Current theory on the evolution of pursuit-deterrent signals predicts that it may be advantageous for the prey to communicate to the predator its alertness and its ability to escape an attack. I tested these predictions by staging predator-prey encounters between A. cristatellus lizards and a model of one of its predators under natural conditions. Results supported the use of pushup displays as pursuit-deterrent signals. The intensity of signals, measured as the number of pushups given during predation episodes, was significantly positively correlated with individual physiological condition measured as endurance capacity. Because endurance capacity can be a critical aspect limiting the ability of A. cristatellus to escape a predatory attack, pushup displays can potentially communicate an individual's ability to escape an attack and, therefore, can be categorized as honest signals. Furthermore, because pushup displays are widely used during anoline social interactions, predation pressure and sexual selection may simultaneously favour the evolution of honest communication to allow both the predator and the potential mate or male rival to assess individual quality using the same signal.

	Abstract = {Sexual dimorphisms in the central nervous system exist in numerous vertebrate species, and in many cases these structural differences between males and females parallel differences in the display of reproductive behaviors. Often both the behavioral and anatomical differences are controlled by exposure to gonadal steroid hormones, either during ontogeny or in adulthood. This article reviews some of the evidence supporting the hypothesis that in mammals, testosterone or its metabolites regulate the structure and function of neural and muscle systems involved in the control of masculine sexual behaviors. It then describes data suggesting that the mechanisms regulating sexually dimorphic courtship systems in zebra finches and green anole lizards are not completely parallel to the mammalian systems. Finally, some directions for future study are suggested, with the hope that they will stimulate thought about the nature of comparisons made across vertebrate models when investigators are attempting to determine both which morphological sex differences are important to the control of the reproductive behaviors, and which mechanisms regulating both structure and function are widely employed or are unique.},

These opsins were expressed in COS1 cells and reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal. The purified visual pigments of the cat, horse, squirrel, deer, and guinea pig have lambdamax values at 553, 545, 532, 531, and 516 nm, respectively, which are precise to within +/-1 nm. We also regenerated the "true" red pigment of goldfish (Carassius auratus), which has a lambdamax value at 559 +/- 4 nm. Multiple linear regression analyses show that S180A, H197Y, Y277F, T285A, and A308S shift the lambdamax values of the red and green pigments in mammals toward blue by 7, 28, 7, 15, and 16 nm, respectively, and the reverse amino acid changes toward red by the same extents. The additive effects of these amino acid changes fully explain the red-green color vision in a wide range of mammalian species, goldfish, American chameleon (Anolis carolinensis), and pigeon (Columba livia).},

	Abstract = {Recent years have seen an increased emphasis on measuring ecologically relevant performance capabilities to understand associations between morphology and habitat use. Such studies presume that performance is invariant, but in eight Caribbean Anolis lizard species, we found that maximal sprinting ability depends on surface diameter. Moreover, these species differ in the degree to which sprint speed declines with decreasing surface diameter, defined as "sprint sensitivity" (high sprint sensitivity=substantial declines in speed between broad and narrow dowels). The habitat constraint hypothesis postulates that Anolis lizards will avoid structural habitats in which their maximal sprinting capabilities are impaired. The habitat breadth hypothesis postulates that species whose performance is less affected by substrate will use a greater variety of habitats than species whose performance varies to a greater extent on surfaces of different diameters. Field observations quantified the proportion of time that lizards spent on different perch diameters. Both hypotheses were confirmed: species with high values of sprint sensitivity avoided using perches on which their maximal sprinting abilities are impaired, whereas species with low sprint sensitivity used such "submaximal" surfaces more frequently. Species with low sprint sensitivity used a broader range of structural habitats than species with high sprint sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {The alpha1 connexin (connexin43) is regarded as the major gap junction protein of the myocardium because it predominates there in mammals. Here, we show that it is not the major connexin of the working myocardium in non-mammalian vertebrates, which instead express beta1-like connexins homologous to mammalian connexin32. A phylogenetic series of hearts was immunostained with seven antibodies raised against peptide sequences specific for three distinct members of the gap junction connexin family: alpha1, beta1 and alpha5 (mammalian connexin40/avian connexin42). Working myocardium from two ascidian chordates (Ciona and Mogula), a teleost (Carassius), a frog (Xenopus) and two reptiles (Anolis and Alligator) was found to express a beta1-like connexin, rather than an alpha1-like connexin. An alpha1-like connexin was nevertheless often detected in other cardiac tissues. In the chicken (by ancestry a reptile), the developing myocardium expressed a beta1-like connexin strongly on embryonic day 6 but less strongly at hatching, and minimally in the adult. Myocardial expression of alpha5 connexin increased during development, but remained strongest in the coronary vascular endothelial and cardiac conduction tissues. The arteriolar smooth muscle of the chicken expressed alpha1 connexin throughout development, but its myocardium did not. In contrast, the working myocardium of a marsupial mammal (the opossum Trichosurus) strongly expressed an alpha1 connexin just like placental mammals. These results imply that a shift from beta1 to alpha1 connexin expression in the heart occurred prior to the evolution of the opossums. The beta and alpha connexin subfamilies have different permeabilities and gating properties, and we discuss factors that might have made this shift beneficial.},

	Abstract = {The temperature dependence of miniature endplate current (MEPC) amplitude (A(c)), 20-80% rise time (t(r)), and 90-33% fall-time (t(f)) was determined for lizard (Anolis carolinensis) intercostal muscle using broadband extracellular (EC) and voltage clamp (VC) recordings. Voltage clamp methods were optimized for the fast MEPC rising phase using custom electronics. From 0-43 degrees C, A(c) increased by approximately 4.2-fold, while t(r) and t(f) decreased by approximately 3.6- and approximately 9.5-fold, respectively. Arrhenius plots were smoothly curved, with small apparent Q(10) (A(c)) or (Q(10))(-1) (t(r) and t(f)) values mostly well below 2.0. Nearly identical extracellular and voltage clamp results ruled out measurement artifacts, even for the shortest t(r) values (<60 microseconds). Monte Carlo simulation of MEPCs showed that a single underlying rate cannot determine the observed temperature dependence. To quantitatively reproduce the experimental t(f) results, a minimal model required activation energies of 46.0 (Q(10) approximately 2.0) and 63.6 (Q(10) approximately 2.5) kJ mol(-1) for channel opening and closing, respectively, and accounted for most of the observed changes in A(c) and t(r) as well. Thus, relatively large but offsetting temperature sensitivities of channel gating mostly govern and minimize the temperature dependence of MEPCs, preserving the safety factor for neuromuscular transmission. Additional temperature-sensitive parameters that could fine-tune the minimal model are discussed.},

	Abstract = {During the breeding season, male green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) court females by extending a red throat fan called a dewlap. Motoneurons controlling this sexually dimorphic behavior are located in two portions of the brain stem: (a) the vagal portion of nucleus ambiguus (AmbX), and (b) the region containing the glossopharyngeal portion of nucleus ambiguus and the ventral motor nucleus of the facial nerve (AmbIX/VIImv). These motoneurons project to the ceratohyoideus muscle via the ramus pharyngo-laryngeus IX+X. To investigate the effects of season on and androgen regulation of neural and peripheral structures controlling dewlap extension, two experiments were conducted: (a) During the breeding and nonbreeding seasons, motoneuron number, soma size, and nucleus size were investigated in intact males and females and in castrated males treated with a testosterone propionate (TP) or a blank Silastic capsule. (b) Cross-sectional area of the nerve and muscle fiber size, number, and density were investigated in the four treatment groups during the breeding season only. No significant differences were found in motoneuron number. In the breeding season, subtle male-biased sex differences existed in both AmbX and AmbIX/VIImv soma size. Nerve cross-sectional area and muscle fiber size and number were substantially larger in males than females. Muscle fiber density was higher in females. No consistent effects due to season or androgen treatment were detected, although characteristics of motoneurons were in some cases slightly larger in the nonbreeding season. These results suggest that, while parallels to behavior exist between the sexes, morphological changes in adulthood in the dewlap motoneurons and muscle do not normally regulate courtship behavior in the male green anole.},

An anole will pursue a prey if and only if it is within this threshold of the anole's perch. The learning algorithm was proposed by Roughgarden and his colleagues. They experimentally determined that this algorithm quickly converges to the foraging threshold that is predicted by optimal foraging theory. We provide analytic confirmation that the optimal foraging behavior as predicted by Roughgarden's model can be attained by a lizard that follows this simple and zoologically plausible rule of thumb.

	Abstract = {We sought to characterize podocytes in the kidneys of numerous species from amphibians to mammals because of the pivotal function of these cells in renal diseases. For this purpose, intermediate filament (IF) proteins of podocytes were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies against vimentin, cytokeratins, and desmin. These staining patterns were then compared to those of parietal cells of Bowman's capsule and tubular cells of the first portion of the proximal tubule from the same sources. As a result, podocytes from mammals (rat, rabbit, dog, cow, and human) and birds (chicken) showed intense vimentin staining without exception, but rarely staining for cytokeratins or desmin. Parietal cells from all these animals were highly heterogeneous with respect to cytokeratin or vimentin staining. Of the tubular cells, only those from humans and chickens were reactive and then only with anti-cytokeratin antibodies. In the reptiles (Chrysemys scripta elegans, Chinemys reeveri, Elaphe quadrivirgata, and Anolis carolinensis), podocytes and other epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratins. Vimentin staining differed among the species, but was not characteristic for podocytes. Anti-desmin antibody reacted strongly only with podocytes from Anolis. In amphibians (Rana catesbeiana and Xenopus laevis), anti-desmin antibody stained podocytes more intensely than any other cell. Cytokeratin and vimentin staining did not differentiate podocytes from the other cell types. These findings indicate that podocytes are characterized by intense vimentin staining in the higher vertebrates and by desmin staining in the lower vertebrates denoting potentially distinctive physiological functions of IF proteins in podocytes from each of these groups.},

	Abstract = {Sexual behaviors in green anoles are regulated by steroid hormones. Androgens activate the display of masculine courtship and copulatory behaviors, and estradiol activates feminine receptivity. Testosterone can also facilitate receptivity in females. The present study was conducted to test the role of converting testosterone to estradiol (aromatization) in the regulation of sexual and aggressive behaviors. Adult males and females were gonadectomized and implanted with a Silastic capsule containing either testosterone propionate (T) or estradiol benzoate (E) or with an empty (blank, BL) capsule. T- and BL-treated animals were then given injections of either Fadrozole (FAD, an aromatase inhibitor) or saline (SAL). E-treated animals received saline injections. Each individual was then tested alternately with male and female stimulus animals. Overall, T stimulated masculine sexual behaviors and receptivity, but the androgen had little effect on the display of aggressive behaviors. The inhibition of aromatase activity by treatment with Fadrozole eliminated the effect of T on receptivity. In contrast, Fadrozole treatment had no effect on mounting behavior or the frequency of courtship bouts. The inhibition of aromatase activity did increase the number of dewlap extensions (the display of a red throat fan) during courtship. These results suggest that the metabolism of testosterone to estradiol is a mechanism through which androgens can facilitate receptivity, and that such aromatization of testosterone is not required for the display of masculine sexual behaviors. In addition, females performed courtship and mounting behaviors less frequently than males, suggesting that an organizational component to steroid hormone regulation of sexual behaviors may exist in the anole.},

	Abstract = {Previous work demonstrated that the brains of many reptiles, including the American chameleon Anolis carolinensis (A. carolinensis), are functionally 'split'. Because the left eye in this species projects predominantly to the right hemisphere, and vice versa, inferences about lateralized brain functioning can be made in A. carolinensis by observation of eye use during behavioral encounters. Using this model, past work suggested that territorial aggression in Anolis is under the preferential control of the right hemisphere, and that acute stress or chronic alcohol exposure selectively reduces right hemisphere mediated territorial aggression. In addition, drugs which increase serotonin (5-HT) in the synaptic cleft inhibit aggressive responding in anoles in both hemispheres. The current experiment examined whether or not the administration of the serotonin agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamine) tetralin (8-OHDPAT), quipazine, or meta-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG) alter territorial aggression in Anolis. Nine adult socially isolated male A. carolinensis underwent a series of behavioral trials during which an antagonistic male was introduced into the cage. Once stable responding was initiated, all subjects were injected in a semi-randomized crossover manner with the following agents, (1) lactated Ringer's, (2) the 5-HT2 agonist quipazine (1.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg), (3) the 5-HT1 agonist 8-OHDPAT (83 mg/kg), and (4) the 5-HT3 agonist mCPBG (3.0 mg/kg and 9 mg/kg). Twenty minutes post injections, the male intruder was reintroduced into the subject's cage. Several behaviors were recorded, including: (1) the time to the first aggressive response, (2) the number of aggressive episodes mediated by the left eye or right eye, and (3) changes in skin color and posture. Aggressive responding was virtually eliminated in all subjects injected with 8-OHDPAT. On the other hand, one-way ANOVA found that both the 9 mg/kg dose of mCPBG (P=0.007), and the 3.0 mg/kg dose of quipazine (P=0.035), selectively decreased territorial aggression mediated by the left eye/right hemisphere compared to lactated Ringer's controls, but had no effect on aggression mediated by the right eye/left hemisphere. Although 8-OHDPAT inhibited aggression, injected subjects developed phenotypic displays of aggressive coloring/posturing, such as blackening of the eye spot and a raising of the neck crest. These results suggest that aggressive action can be differentiated from phenotypic displays that accompany aggression by a 5-HT1 agonist. They also indicate that there is an asymmetrical effect of 5-HT2/5-HT3 serotonin agonists on hemispheric mediation of aggression in this species.},

	Abstract = {The lateralized effects of ethanol (ETOH) upon behavior and monoamine biochemistry in the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, were examined. Eight adult male anoles consumed solutions of 19% ethanol (ETOH) twice daily over the course of 18 days, while controls consumed water. ETOH decreased the use of the left eye/right hemisphere, but not the right eye/left hemisphere, during territorial aggression (p<0.05). During crossover (i.e., ETOH to water and vice versa) this effect was reversible and replicable. Biochemically, an asymmetry was observed in 5-HT levels in the raphe both in ETOH and controls. ETOH increased levels of serotonin (5-HT; p<0.05), and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios (p<0.05) in the raphe; serotonin levels in several brain regions correlated with aggressive responses. These results suggest that ETOH boosts 5-HT levels in animals subchronically exposed to ETOH. They further suggest that asymmetry in endogenous 5-HT systems may account for the asymmetrical regulation of aggression generally, and may explain the behavioral effects of ETOH upon lateralized aggression.},

	Abstract = {Stressful aggressive interaction stimulates central serotonergic activation in telencephalon as well as brainstem. Social roles can be distinguished by monoamine activity following aggression. Pairs of male lizards, Anolis carolinensis, were allowed to fight and form dominant/subordinate relationships. In micropunched regions of telencephalon, the greatest serotonergic changes occur in subordinate males. In hippocampal cortex and nucleus accumbens, subordinate males have increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/serotonin at 1 h following the fight. In these areas the ratio gradually decreases over a week of cohabitation, as was previously reported for brainstem. Medial and lateral amygdala develop increased serotonergic activity more slowly, with the greatest increase being evident following a week of interaction. Turnover, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in amygdala escalate over the first week of interaction in subordinate males, and return to baseline by one month. In dominant males, the pattern is accelerated, with the most extensive serotonin system activity present at 1 h, then decreasing over a month. The patterns of serotonergic activation are so similar in hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and brainstem that a co-ordinated response may be involved in mediating short-term social stress and aggression. Similarly, medial and lateral amygdala exhibit corresponding, but delayed patterns in subordinate males, suggesting a co-ordinated response in these regions mediating longer-term stress responses. These data are consistent with rapid neuroendocrine stress modulation in dominant individuals, and delayed serotonergic activity changes in subordinate males.},

The oocysts of each species have no micropyles or residua and the sporocysts lack Stieda bodies, but all have a sporocyst residuum. Eimeria sanctaluciae n.sp. was found in the St. Lucia tree lizard, Anolis luciae, collected from the Maria Islands, Lesser Antilles. The oocysts are spherical to subspherical, averaging 17.3 x 16.5 microns, with a single layered colourless wall; about 60% contain polar granules. The sporocysts are ellipsoidal and average 7.7 x 5.5 microns. Eimeria liolaemi n.sp. was recovered from the blue-gold swift, Liolaemus taenius, from Chile. The oocysts are spherical to subspherical, measuring 21 x 20.1 microns with a single-layered colourless wall. The sporocysts are subspherical and average 7.4 x 6.8 microns. Eimeria caesicia n.sp. is described from the Brazilian collared iguanid, Tropidurus torquatus. The oocysts measure 27.4 x 23.7 microns, are spherical to subspherical, with a bilayered wall, the outer surface of which appears pale blue in colour, the thin, inner wall appearing brown, when viewed by direct light under the optical microscope. The sporocysts are subspherical and average 9.4 x 7.2 microns. Unnamed polysporocystid oocysts with dizoic sporocysts are reported from the faeces of the lesser St. Vincent tree lizard, Anolis trinitatis and the possibility of spurious parasitism briefly discussed. In addition, oocysts of an unnamed Isospora sp. with a smooth oocyst wall which closely resembles I. reui were recovered from A. trinitatis.},

Neurons innervating the ceratohyoid muscle were retrogradely labeled by injecting the muscle with fast blue and were found to be located in the vagal portion of nucleus ambiguus (Amb X), as well as in the region containing the glossopharyngeal portion of nucleus ambiguus (Amb IX) and the ventral portion of the motor nucleus of the facial nerve (nVIImv).

	Abstract = {The formation of the first epidermal generations and in particular of the shedding complex in the developing scales of the lizards Anolis lineatopus and Podarcis muralis was studied by electron microscopy. The initially linear and bilayered epidermis turned into symmetric papillae, which became asymmetric scales. The outer periderm was more electrondense than the following layer, provisionally named 'inner periderm' but probably derived from the basal layer. Coarse thick filaments progressively filled the cytoplasm of the inner periderm or formed reticulate bodies resembling avian peridermal granules. Peridermal cells cornified slightly and could be shed in ovo. From the basal layer various suprabasal epithelial layers were produced. The first layer contained keratohyalin-like granules and was identified as a clear layer. Beneath it a spinulated (Anolis) or serrated (Podarcis) oberhautchen differentiated. The clear and 'oberhautchen' layers constitute the first shedding complex. The first epidermal layers that were shed consisted of flaking periderm or periderm together with the clear layer. The differentiation of a mesos layer was under way before hatching, when the epidermal morphology resembled a stage 4-5 of the adult shedding cycle. Fibroblasts under the inner side of the scale made few contacts with the basement membrane and their cytoplasmic elongations were mostly oriented parallel to the dense lamina. Instead, fibroblasts under the basal layer of the outer scale surface (BLOS) made numerous contacts with the basement membrane, suggesting that more dermal-epidermal interactions take place on this side of the scale.},

Both testosterone and corticosterone levels in adult males captured in the Miami, Florida, area varied significantly with month and with season (i.e., breeding vs. nonbreeding period), although they were not significantly correlated with each other or with body mass. Mean monthly testosterone levels were higher during the breeding season (March-August) than during the nonbreeding season, with the one exception that the highest mean testosterone level occurred in February immediately before the beginning of the breeding season. Testosterone levels in the overall sample of 144 males were significantly correlated with testes mass but not with any of the other measured variables. Corticosterone levels were highest during the nonbreeding season and lowest during the breeding season. Corticosterone levels on a monthly basis were negatively correlated with monthly changes in testes mass and positively correlated with monthly changes in abdominal fat-body mass.},

We tested this proposition by examining the evolutionary radiation of Anolis lizards on the four islands of the Greater Antilles. Morphometric analyses indicate that the same set of habitat specialists, termed ecomorphs, occurs on all four islands. Although these similar assemblages could result from a single evolutionary origin of each ecomorph, followed by dispersal or vicariance, phylogenetic analysis indicates that the ecomorphs originated independently on each island. Thus, adaptive radiation in similar environments can overcome historical contingencies to produce strikingly similar evolutionary outcomes.},

	Abstract = {We released juvenile Anolis aeneus lizards into vacant patches of habitat in the field and observed as they established territories. Individuals settling in the presence of few competitors obtained more exclusive home ranges than did individuals settling at higher densities. When settling at high densities, juveniles that eventually attained high social status fought and chased their opponents more frequently than did juveniles that were subordinate to other residents at the end of the settlement period. With respect to predicting an individual's final status and space use, however, the fact that it fought other settlers was more important than the outcome of those fights. Results from this and previous studies in this series are consistent with a general model of territory establishment that includes assumptions about the value of familiar space, the costs of aggressive interactions and the ability of settlers to form predictable social relationships with one another.Copyright 1998 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

	Abstract = {Using only 11-cis 3, 4-dehydroretinal as a chromophore in the pure-cone retina, American chameleon (Anolis carolinensis) detects a wide range of color from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared. We previously characterized its visual opsin genes sws1Ac, sws2Ac, rh1Ac, rh2Ac, and LwsAc that encode SWS1Ac, SWS2Ac, RH1Ac, RH2Ac, and LWSAc opsins, respectively, and the pineal gland-specific opsin (PAc) gene. Here we present the light absorption profiles of the visual pigments obtained by expressing these opsins and reconstituting them with 11-cis retinal using the COS1 cell cDNA expression system. The purified SWS1Ac, SWS2Ac, RH1Ac, RH2Ac, LWSAc, and PAc pigments have the wavelengths of maximal absorption at 358, 437, 491, 495, 560, and 482 nm, respectively. SWS1Ac is the first vertebrate UV opsin whose spectral sensitivity has been directly evaluated. RH1 pigments, orthologous to the rod pigments of other vertebrates, are sensitive to hydroxylamine in the dark, exhibiting a cone pigment-like characteristic, probably reflecting their adaptation to the pure cone retina. Interestingly, the blue-sensitive SWS2Ac pigment shows an exceptionally low level of sensitivity to hydroxylamine, possessing a rod pigment-like characteristic.},

	Abstract = {Previous work has demonstrated that the brain of Anolis carolinensis is functionally split, in that the left and right eyes project predominantly to the contralateral hemisphere, and as there are minimal connections between the left and right hemispheres. Using this model, the current experiment examined the effect of mild acute stress on hemispheric regulation of territorial aggression. Thirteen adult male Anolis were paired with an antagonistic males, and eye use and behavioral responses were repeatedly measured during 3 minute behavioral trials. Trials were conducted either after exposure to mild stress, produced by handling the subject, or without stress, and they were run either in the subject's home cage or in a cage foreign to the subject. Left eye preference for aggressive movements was found during the trials run in the non-stressed conditions (p < 0.05). Conversely, stressed subjects showed a reduction in left eye/right hemisphere mediated aggressive movements relative to the non-stressed subjects but no changes in right eye/left hemisphere aggression. This effect was independent of whether or not the subject was in its home or a foreign cage. No laterality in aggressive responding was found when the subjects were placed in separate cages with visual contact. These findings suggest that territorial aggression in Anolis is preferentially initiated and processed by the left eye/right hemisphere but is subject to right-hemispheric inhibition following exposure to acute mild stress.},

	Abstract = {We examined conspicuous signalling displays in the context of predator-prey interactions. To determine in which context Puerto Rican crested anoles, Anolis cristatellusperform conspicuous signals, we exposed wild lizards to a model of a natural snake predator. The lizards gave six behavioural responses to the model: immobility, predator inspection, flight, lateral face-off, dewlapping and push-ups. They displayed significantly more push-ups and push-up bouts in the presence of the snake model. Alternative theories regarding the function of conspicuous signals in A. cristatellusthe flash concealment and predator deterrent hypotheses, were also tested. The flash concealment hypothesis proposes that the sudden display exhibition of signalling behaviour followed by the flight of the animal may confuse the predator about the position of the prey, thus causing the predator to abort the attack. The pursuit deterrent hypothesis contends that because the chances of the predator successfully attacking its prey decrease when the prey is aware of the incoming predator, prey have evolved signalling behaviours that communicate to the predator that it has been detected, therefore discouraging the attack. Results supported the use of push-ups, dewlapping, lateral face-off and predator inspection as predator deterrent signals. During the recognition phase of a predatory encounter, A. cristatellus may rely more on behavioural signals than on flight to avoid predation. Because the predator deterrent signals are the same as the signals used in social interactions, it is suggested that predation pressure may have reinforced the effects of sexual selection in the evolution of Anolis signalling displays.Copyright 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour1997The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

	Abstract = {Central monoamines display a variety of activation patterns in different social groups, and among males and females. We addressed three social conditions for female lizards of the species Anolis carolinensis: Isolated, paired with a mate, and in a group of 5 competing for one mate. Among those in a group, only 1 or 2 females exhibited recrudescing ovaries. Individuals paired with a mate (for one month) exhibited ovarian growth, isolated animals (initial controls) had quiescent ovaries. Reproductively dominant females had significantly greater telencephalic 5-HIAA, and serotonergic activation, as indicated by the ratio of 5-HIAA to 5-HT. Telencephalic HVA as well as the HVA/DA ratio were also significantly greater in dominant females compared to all other groups. In contrast, serotonergic activation in brainstem was elevated in subordinate females only. These results suggest that serotonergic activation in telencephalon, found only in dominant females, not in other reproductively active females, is a function of the unique social role of a dominant female, possibly combining submissive behaviors toward a male with dominance over other females and competition for access to that male. Dopaminergic activation in telencephalon, also found only in dominant females, may be related to aggressive interactions with other females. Activation of serotonin in brainstem, found in this study in subordinate females and previously in males [C.H. Summers and N. Greenberg, Activation of central biogenic amines following aggressive interaction in male lizards, Anolis carolinensis, Brain Behav. Evol., 45 (1995) 339-349], may be associated with subordinate social status. Monoamines, involved in social behaviors, appear to be regionally specialized for dominant and subordinate social roles, in males [C.H. Summers and N. Greenberg, Activation of central biogenic amines following aggressive interaction in male lizards, Anolis carolinensis, Brain Behav. Evol., 45 (1995) 339-349][T.R. Summers, E.T. Larson, A.L. Hunter, K.J. Renner, N. Greenberg and C.H. Summers, Amygdalar serotonin mediates long-term social roles following aggressive interaction, Soc. Neurosci. Abs., 22 (1996) 1147] and females. Dominant females exhibit unique social position, behavior and monoamine profile whereas subordinate females and males have a similar serotonergic response in this species.},

	Abstract = {The lizard Anolis carolinensis alternates ovulation, and the resultant ovarian asymmetry correlates with alternating asymmetry of hypothalamic catecholamines. Unilateral and bilateral ovariectomies of cycling females were performed to determine if ovarian manipulations influence hypothalamic catecholamine asymmetries. During the middle of the ovarian cycle, we removed the larger ovary, i.e., the next one to ovulate an egg (N = 9), the smaller ovary with its corpus luteum (N = 8), or both ovaries (N = 5). A sham-operated control group was included (N = 9). The diameter of the largest ovarian follicle in each ovary was measured at the beginning and end of the experiment. After 12 days, the hemihypothalami from the sides of the initial smaller ovary (SO) and larger ovary (LO) were dissected and frozen for determination of monoamines and their metabolites using HPLC and electrochemical detection. Monoamine and metabolite concentrations at the end of the experiment in the original SO and LO sides of each hypothalamus were compared with an asymmetry ratio, or AR, of (SO side - LO side)/(SO side + LO side). No female ovulated during the experiment. Unilateral ovariectomy caused compensatory growth of the largest follicle in the remaining ovary. Removal of the SO or LO caused the AR of DOPAC to favor the brain side ipsilateral to that of the ovarian removal. Removal of the LO switched the NE AR from the SO to the LO side. Removal of the LO or SO caused the MHPG AR to favor the LO side. Ovariectomy of any kind caused 5-HT, which in the sham-operated animals favored the SO side, to become symmetric, and removal of the LO caused the 5-HIAA AR to favor the LO side. We conclude that the ovaries influence hypothalamic catecholamine asymmetries in Anolis via direct neural (as well as hormonal) pathways and that sensory input from the ovaries to the hypothalamus could be involved in control of ovarian alternation via both neural and hormonal efferent mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {The presence of multiple forms of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) within a single brain is common among vertebrate species. In previous studies of reptiles, two forms of GnRH were isolated from the brain of alligators and the primary structure was determined to be that of chicken (c)GnRH-I and cGnRH-II. GnRH has also been detected by indirect methods in other reptiles including turtles, lizards, and snakes. We used a combination of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and radioimmunoassay to determine the number and molecular form(s) of GnRH in the brain of a lizard, Anolis carolinensis, that was reported to lack GnRH cells in the forebrain. Immunoreactivity was detected in the same HPLC elution position in which synthetic cGnRH-II elutes, but not in any other position. Detection was based on five antisera that among them detect the 12 known forms of GnRH; these antisera include ones that are specific to cGnRH-I and cGnRH-II. We conclude that the lizard A. carolinensis contains cGnRH-II, but not cGnRH-I or another known form of GnRH. These data, coupled with our earlier immunocytochemical study, suggest that the lizard studied here lacks cGnRH-I, the form that is found in the terminal nerve, olfactory bulb, and forebrain in nonsquamate reptiles and in birds. Our hypothesis is that the presence of both cGnRH-I and cGnRH-II in the brain is ancestral in the reptilian lineage and retained in the orders that include turtles (Chelonia) or alligators (Crocodilia). However, the pattern in the order Squamata varies: in A. carolinensis, only cGnRH-II is present in the brain and cGnRH-I is absent, whereas in the snake Thamnophilis sirtalis, cGnRH-I is retained and cGnRH-II is absent in the brain, as recently reported. This raises the question of how reproduction is controlled in reptiles that lack one form of GnRH.},

	Abstract = {The stereovillar bundles of hair cells show active movements that may be generated by the putative myosin-actin interactions underlying hair-cell adaptation. Such movement is a possible candidate for the generation of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAE) in the ear canal of nonmammals. In the basilar papilla of certain lizard families, most hair cells are not coupled by a tectorial membrane, making it easier to assign the energy in emission peaks to defined groups of hair cells. We have studied 62 SOAE in the Bahamian Anole Anolis sagrei, which has about 140 hair cells with "free-standing" bundles in the high-frequency area of its papilla. Individual SOAE peaks were traced to between 3 and 38 hair cells, and the mean power output per hair cell was calculated to be 141 aW. The number of bundle myosins putatively involved in the generation of each SOAE was estimated and the force generated by each myosin at 1 kHz calculated to be approximately 0.1 pN. The data support the idea that hair cells generate emissions and suggest that myosin produces sufficient power to be the emission motor.},

	Abstract = {Receptors for guanylin and uroguanylin were identified on the mucosal surface of enterocytes lining the intestine of the bobtail skink (Tiliqua rugosa), king's skink (Egernia kingii), and knight anole (Anolis equestris) by receptor autoradiography using 125I-ST (Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin) as the radioligand. Specific, high-affinity binding of 125I-ST to receptors was found on the microvillus border of enterocytes and little or no specific binding of 125I-ST was observed in other strata comprising the gut wall. The American alligator (Alligator mississippensis) also exhibited receptor binding, but unlike the other three species had relatively high levels of apparent nonspecific binding. A comparison of intestinal cGMP accumulation responses between the American alligator and the knight anole demonstrated a greater magnitude of cGMP responses to ST and guanylin in vitro in the knight anole relative to the tissue cGMP accumulation responses of alligators. Treatment with ST resulted in markedly greater tissue cGMP accumulation responses in both species compared to treatment with guanylin. To complete a paracrine signaling pathway in reptilian intestine, guanylin-like peptides that stimulated cGMP accumulation in human T84 intestinal cells were isolated from the intestinal mucosa of alligators. We conclude that functional receptor-guanylyl cyclases and one or more endogenous guanylin/uroguanylin-like peptides occur in the intestinal tract of reptiles as well as in the intestines of mammals and birds. Thus, higher vertebrates have a conserved signaling pathway that regulates intestinal function through the first-messenger peptides, guanylin and/or uroguanylin, and the intracellular second messenger, cGMP.},

@article{Deckel:1997aa,
	Abstract = {Previous work has suggested that the lizard Anolis carolinensis, like many other reptiles, has a functionally split brain. Specifically, the left eye of this species projects primarily to the right hemisphere (and vice versa), there is no corpus callosum, and the physical placement of the eyes restricts their field(s) of vision to one region of hemispace. The current experiment used this preparation to examine the effect of alcohol administration and withdrawal on lateralized brain functioning during territorial aggression. Thirteen adult males were divided into control (CON) or alcohol (ETOH) groups. Baseline territorial aggression was assessed, following which ETOH subjects were then given twice daily solutions of 19% alcohol. After 19 days of ETOH consumption, territorial aggression was again assessed. Eye use during aggressive encounters was measured either following short periods (24 h) of alcohol withdrawal, or 90 m following alcohol consumption. Control subjects were found to have a predominance of left eye/right hemisphere-mediated aggressive responses, as has previously been reported. Alcohol withdrawn subjects were found to have a suppression of left eye/right hemisphere-mediated aggression. This reached statistical significance on several measures of aggression, including the number of dewlaps and headbob (P < 0.001) and the total number of aggressive responses (P = 0.001). Consumption of ETOH reversed this pattern and reinstated the normal pattern of left eye/right hemisphere dominance during aggression. Conversely, right eye/left hemisphere mediation of aggression was found to be increased, or not affected, during alcohol withdrawal, and to show no differences from CON following ETOH administration. Extrapolating from other recent findings in this species, these results suggest that the stress caused by ETOH withdrawal on the CNS may differentially effect the right hemisphere of the brain while having little effect on the left.},

	Abstract = {Activities of the steroid metabolizing enzymes aromatase and 5 alpha-reductase have been documented in species ranging from fish to humans, yet relatively little work has been done in this area in reptiles. In the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, steroid hormones are critical to the display of both masculine and feminine sexual behaviors. For example, dihydrotestosterone and testosterone can stimulate both masculine courtship and copulatory behaviors, and estrogen and testosterone facilitate feminine receptivity. These results suggest roles for both aromatase (which catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to estradiol) and 5 alpha-reductase (which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone). This study documents the presence of both enzymes in the brain of the green anole and indicates that the activity of 5 alpha-reductase is much higher than that of aromatase in whole brain homogenates. However, differences exist among brain regions, such that aromatase activity is higher in preoptic area/hypothalamic dissections, whereas 5 alpha-reductase is much more active in the brain stem. These variations in regional enzyme activity may influence steroid hormone regulation of specific sexual behaviors in male and female anoles.},

	Abstract = {We have previously reported that melatonin was an effective lightening agonist in the teleost Synbranchus marmoratus, the amphibians Rana pipiens and Bufo ictericus, and in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. The hormone, previously applied to the preparations, effectively inhibited alpha-MSH darkening activity in a dose-independent manner, and was also able to reverse MSH-induced darkening. We presently describe the inhibitory effect of the indoleamine on the murine melanoma cell proliferation. Interestingly, the hormone also stimulated tyrosinase activity, with a correlated increase in melanin content. We also demonstrate that in a diverse lizard species, Urosaurus ornatus, the indoleamine was totally ineffective. The competitive MSH antagonistic activity of H-His-D-Arg-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2 has been demonstrated previously in R. pipiens and U. ornatus. Herein, its inhibitory activity is also reported in another lizard species, A. carolinensis. However, this MSH analogue was inactive in S. marmoratus, and in murine melanoma cells. On the other hand, the 7 thru 10 alpha-MSH fragment, Ac-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-NH2, although ineffective in S. marmoratus and R. pipiens, was an alpha-MSH antagonist in A. carolinensis. Surprisingly, in the melanoma cell line, the MSH fragment exhibited no agonist or antagonist activity, but dramatically potentiated the MSH-induced increase in tyrosinase activity. These data might suggest that the fragment is participating either in the process of facilitation or in positive cooperativity. The present results, taken together with our previously reported data, demonstrate a major interspecies diversity of the MC1 subtype of melanocortin receptor, and point out the relevance of the membrane microenvironment for the final receptor configuration.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of immunoreactive gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRHir) in relation to endocrine and behavioral pathways is not well established for lizards. To more completely understand the GnRHir distribution and its possible function in a lizard, we investigated the brain of Anolis carolinensis, a species whose visual courtship displays, mating postures and gonadal cycles are well known. Using antisera that recognize multiple GnRH forms, we observed no GnRHir cells or fibers in the forebrain. In the midbrain, however, GnRHir cells occurred along the medial border of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. These cells appeared to project GnRHir fibers to nuclei of cranial nerve III and IV. In the hindbrain, positive fibers were observed in the area of the vestibular nuclei and dorsal funiculus. These hindbrain fibers were followed to their terminals in the cerebellum. The GnRHir midbrain distribution suggests an association of GnRH with eye movements, whereas the hindbrain distribution suggests a GnRH-vestibular association. The lack of GnRHir in the forebrain of Anolis could reflect the minimal role of the vomeronasal system in mediating reproduction in this species. Thus, our study cannot verify hypothalamic GnRH control of the pituitary in A. carolinensis, but it does indicate GnRH control of oculomotor and vestibular nuclei, which might play a role in Anolis reproductive behaviors.},

@article{Sanz:2012aa,
	Abstract = {The evolutionary pathway of highly toxic proteins expressed in snake venom glands from proteins without toxic function and expressed in non-parotid tissues remains poorly understood. Here we examine gene structure of a representative of a venom protein with an ADAMs metalloproteinase evolutionary origin. The structure of the 15,652 bp Echis ocellatus pre-pro EOC00089-like PIII-SVMP gene was assembled from PCR-amplified sequences of overlapping genomic fragments. The gene comprises 12 exons interrupted by 11 introns. In a homology model of the EOC00089-like protein, the insertion of introns interrupting coding regions lie just after or between secondary structure elements. Long interspersed nuclear retroelements (LINE) L2/CR1 and RTE/Bov-B, short interspersed nuclear retroelements SINE/Sauria, and a hobo-activator DNA (Charlie, hAT) transposon were identified within introns 1, 3, 7 and 8. Pairwise amino acid sequence comparisons between EOC00089-like PIII-SVMP and its closest orthologs, ADAM28, from a mammal, Homo sapiens, and the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, showed that the ORFs of these three proteins share 42%/59%, 49%/69%, and 48%/65% (identity/similarity), respectively. The protein-coding positions interrupted by each of the 11 introns of the Echis PIII-SVMP gene are entirely conserved in the A. carolinensis and human ADAM28 genes. However, the lizard and the human ADAM28 genes contain 5 introns not present in the E. ocellatus gene. Furthermore, Echis and Anolis introns exhibit quantitatively and qualitatively distinctions in their inserted retroelements. These findings identify introns as possible key elements in the recruitment and amplification process of SVMPs into the venom gland of extant snakes. Ongoing reptile genome sequencing projects may shed light on this intriguing aspect of the emergence and evolution of venom toxin genes. Furthermore, the organization of the PIII-SVMP reported here provides a genomic explanation for the emergence of dimeric disintegrin subunits encoded by short messengers.},

	Abstract = {Complex organismal structures are organized into modules, suites of traits that develop, function, and vary in a coordinated fashion. By limiting or directing covariation among component traits, modules are expected to represent evolutionary building blocks and to play an important role in morphological diversification. But how stable are patterns of modularity over macroevolutionary timescales? Comparative analyses are needed to address the macroevolutionary effect of modularity, but to date few have been conducted. We describe patterns of skull diversity and modularity in Caribbean Anolis lizards. We first diagnose the primary axes of variation in skull shape and then examine whether diversification of skull shape is concentrated to changes within modules or whether changes arose across the structure as a whole. We find no support for the hypothesis that cranial modules are conserved as species diversify in overall skull shape. Instead we find that anole skull shape and modularity patterns independently converge. In anoles, skull modularity is evolutionarily labile and may reflect the functional demands of unique skull shapes. Our results suggest that constraints have played little role in limiting or directing the diversification of head shape in Anolis lizards.},

	Abstract = {The olfactory receptor (OR) genes represent the largest multigene family in the genome of terrestrial vertebrates. Here, the high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach was applied to characterization of OR gene repertoires in the green anole lizard Anolis carolinensis and the Japanese four-lined ratsnake Elaphe quadrivirgata. Tagged polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products amplified from either genomic DNA or cDNA of the two species were used for parallel pyrosequencing, assembling, and screening for errors in PCR and pyrosequencing. Starting from the lizard genomic DNA, we accurately identified 56 of 136 OR genes that were identified from its draft genome sequence. These recovered genes were broadly distributed in the phylogenetic tree of vertebrate OR genes without severe biases toward particular OR families. Ninety-six OR genes were identified from the ratsnake genomic DNA, implying that the snake has more OR gene loci than the anole lizard in response to an increased need for the acuity of olfaction. This view is supported by the estimated number of OR genes in the Burmese python's draft genome ( approximately 280), although squamates may generally have fewer OR genes than terrestrial mammals and amphibians. The OR gene repertoire of the python seems unique in that many class I OR genes are retained. The NGS approach also allowed us to identify candidates of highly expressed and silent OR gene copies in the lizard's olfactory epithelium. The approach will facilitate efficient and parallel characterization of considerable unbiased proportions of multigene family members and their transcripts from nonmodel organisms.},

@article{Cohen:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Neural steroids, as well as the enzymes that produce these hormones, are important for sexual differentiation of the brain during development. Aromatase converts testosterone into oestradiol. 5alpha-reductase converts testosterone to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone and occurs in two isozymes: type 1 (5alphaR1) and type 2 (5alphaR2). Each of these enzymes is present in the developing brain in many species, although no work has been carried out examining the expression of all three enzymes in non-avian reptiles with genetic sex determination. In the present study, we evaluated mRNA expression of neural aromatase, 5alphaR1 and 5alphaR2, on the day of hatching and at day 50 in one such lizard, the green anole. We describe the distribution of these enzymes throughout the brain and the quantification of mRNA expression in three regions that control adult sexual behaviours: the preoptic area (POA) and ventromedial amygdala (AMY), which are involved in male displays, as well as the ventromedial hypothalamus, which regulates female receptivity. Younger animals had a greater number (POA) and density (AMY) of 5alphaR1 mRNA expressing cells. We detected no effects of sex or age on aromatase or 5alphaR2. In comparison with data from adults, the present results support the idea that the green anole forebrain has not completely differentiated by 50 days after hatching and that 5alphaR1 may play a role in the early development of regions important for masculine function.},

	Abstract = {This study provides a morphometric data set of body segments that are biomechanically relevant for locomotion in two ecomorphs of adult male anoles, namely, the trunk-ground Anolis sagrei and the trunk-crown Anolis carolinensis. For each species, 10 segments were characterized, and for each segment, length, mass, location of the center of mass, and radius of gyration were measured or calculated, respectively. The radii of gyration were computed from the moments of inertia by using the double swing pendulum method. The trunk-ground A. sagrei has relatively longer and stockier hindlimbs and forelimbs with smaller body than A. carolinensis. These differences between the two ecomorphs demonstrated a clear relationship between morphology and performance, particularly in the context of predator avoidance behavior, such as running or jumping in A. sagrei and crypsis in A. carolinensis. Our results provide new perspectives on the mechanism of adaptive radiation as the limbs of the two species appear to scale via linear factors and, therefore, may also provide explanations for the mechanism of evolutionary changes of structures within an ecological context.},

	Abstract = {Immunoglobulins are basic molecules of the immune system of vertebrates. In previous studies we described the immunoglobulins found in two squamata reptiles, Anolis carolinensis and Eublepharis macularius. Snakes are squamata reptiles too but they have undergone an extreme evolutionary process. We therefore wanted to know how these changes affected their immunoglobulin coding genes. To perform this analysis we studied five snake transcriptomes and two genome draft sequences. Sequences coding for immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin D (IgD) and two classes of immunoglobulin Y (IgY - named IgYa and IgYb-) were found in all of them. Moreover, the Thamnophis elegans transcriptome and Python molurus genome draft sequences showed a third class of IgY, the IgYc, whose constant region only presents three domains and lacks the CH2. All data suggest that the IgYb is the evolutionary origin of this IgYc. An exhaustive search of the light chains were carried out, being lambda the only light chain found in snakes. The results provide a clear picture of the immunoglobulins present in the suborder Serpentes.},

	Abstract = {Sexual signals are considered costly to produce and maintain under the handicap paradigm, and the reliability of signals is in turn thought to be maintained by these costs. Although previous studies have investigated the costly nature of signal production, few have considered whether honesty might be maintained not by the costliness of the signal itself, but by the costs involved in producing the signalled trait. If such a trait is itself costly to produce, then the burden of energetic investment may fall disproportionately on that trait, in addition to any costs of signal maintenance that may also be operating. Under limited resource conditions, these costs may therefore be great enough to disrupt an otherwise reliable signal-to-trait relationship. We present experimental evidence showing that dietary restriction decouples the otherwise honest relationship between a signal (dewlap size) and a whole-organism performance trait (bite force) in young adult male Anolis carolinensis lizards. Specifically, while investment in dewlap size is sustained under low-resource condition relative to the high-resource treatment, investment in bite force is substantially lower. Disruption of the otherwise honest dewlap size to bite force relationship is therefore driven by costs associated with the expression of performance rather than the costs of signal production in A. carolinensis.},

	Abstract = {Nuclear sequence markers are useful tool for the study of the history of populations and adaptation. However, it is not easy to obtain multiple nuclear primers for organisms with poor or no genomic sequence information. Here we used the genomes of organisms that have been fully sequenced to design comprehensive sets of primers to amplify polymorphic genomic fragments of multiple nuclear genes in non-sequenced organisms. First, we identified a large number of candidate polymorphic regions that were flanked on each side by conserved regions in the reference genomes. We then designed primers based on these conserved sequences and examined whether the primers could be used to amplify sequences in target species, montane brown frog (Rana ornativentris), anole lizard (Anolis sagrei), guppy (Poecilia reticulata), and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), for population genetic analysis. We successfully obtained polymorphic markers for all target species studied. In addition, we found that sequence identities of the regions between the primer sites in the reference genomes affected the experimental success of DNA amplification and identification of polymorphic loci in the target genomes, and that exonic primers had a higher success rate than intronic primers in amplifying readable sequences. We conclude that this comparative genomic approach is a time- and cost-effective way to obtain polymorphic markers for non-sequenced organisms, and that it will contribute to the further development of evolutionary ecology and population genetics for non-sequenced organisms, aiding in the understanding of the genetic basis of adaptation.},

	Abstract = {Circadian rhythms are regulated by an internal clock, which is itself synchronized to environmental cues such as light and temperature. It is widely assumed that the circadian system is adapted to local cues, which vary enormously across habitats, yet the comparative data necessary for testing this idea are lacking. We examined photic and thermal resetting of the circadian clock in five species of Anolis lizards whose microhabitats differ in the amounts of sun and shade. The primary circadian oscillator in Anolis is the pineal gland, which produces the hormone melatonin. A flow-through culture system was employed to measure rhythmic melatonin output from individually cultured pineal glands. All species showed temperature-compensated circadian rhythms of pineal melatonin. Light caused significant phase delays of the melatonin rhythm, and this effect varied among species. Controlling for phylogenetic differences, the results indicate that the pineal glands of shade-dwelling species are more sensitive to photic resetting than species living in more brightly illuminated habitats. The differences were not due to variation in free-running period, but may be due to variation in oscillator phase and/or robustness. Surprisingly, thermal resetting was not statistically significant. Overall, the results suggest that the Anolis circadian system is adapted to photic habitat.},

	Abstract = {Aromatase and 5alpha-reductase (5alphaR) catalyze the synthesis of testosterone (T) metabolites: estradiol and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, respectively. These enzymes are important in controlling sexual behaviors in male and female vertebrates. To investigate factors contributing to their regulation in reptiles, male and female green anole lizards were gonadectomized during the breeding and non-breeding seasons and treated with a T-filled or blank capsule. In situ hybridization was used to examine main effects of and interactions among sex, season, and T on expression of aromatase and one isozyme of 5alphaR (5alphaR2) in three brain regions that control reproductive behaviors: the preoptic area, ventromedial nucleus of the amygdala and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Patterns of mRNA generally paralleled previous evaluations of intact animals. Although no main effects of T were detected, interactions were present in the VMH. Specifically, the density of 5alphaR2 expressing cells was greater in T-treated than control females in this region, regardless of season. Among breeding males, blank-treated males had a denser population of 5alphaR2 positive cells than T-treated males. Overall, T appears to have less of a role in the regulation of these enzymes than in other vertebrate groups, which is consistent with the primary role of T (rather than its metabolites) in regulation of reproductive behaviors in lizards. However, further investigation of protein and enzyme activity levels are needed before specific conclusions can be drawn.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: WASP family proteins stimulate the actin-nucleating activity of the ARP2/3 complex. They include members of the well-known WASP and WAVE/Scar proteins, and the recently identified WASH and WHAMM proteins. WASP family proteins contain family specific N-terminal domains followed by proline-rich regions and C-terminal VCA domains that harbour the ARP2/3-activating regions. RESULTS: To reveal the evolution of ARP2/3 activation by WASP family proteins we performed a "holistic" analysis by manually assembling and annotating all homologs in most of the eukaryotic genomes available. We have identified two new families: the WAML proteins (WASP and MIM like), which combine the membrane-deforming and actin bundling functions of the IMD domains with the ARP2/3-activating VCA regions, and the WAWH protein (WASP without WH1 domain) that have been identified in amoebae, Apusozoa, and the anole lizard. Surprisingly, with one exception we did not identify any alternative splice forms for WASP family proteins, which is in strong contrast to other actin-binding proteins like Ena/VASP, MIM, or NHS proteins that share domains with WASP proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes must have contained a homolog of WASP, WAVE, and WASH. Specific families have subsequently been lost in many taxa like the WASPs in plants, algae, Stramenopiles, and Euglenozoa, and the WASH proteins in fungi. The WHAMM proteins are metazoa specific and have most probably been invented by the Eumetazoa. The diversity of WASP family proteins has strongly been increased by many species- and taxon-specific gene duplications and multimerisations.

However, B. dendrobatidis may also be capable of persisting in the environment, and non-amphibian vectors or hosts may contribute to disease transmission. Reptiles living in close proximity to amphibians and sharing similar ecological traits could serve as vectors or reservoir hosts for B. dendrobatidis, harbouring the organism on their skin without succumbing to disease. We surveyed for the presence of B. dendrobatidis DNA among 211 lizards and 8 snakes at 8 sites at varying elevations in Panama where the syntopic amphibians were at pre-epizootic, epizootic or post-epizootic stages of chytridiomycosis. Detection of B. dendrobatidis DNA was done using qPCR analysis. Evidence of the amphibian pathogen was present at varying intensities in 29 of 79 examined Anolis humilis lizards (32%) and 9 of 101 A. lionotus lizards (9%), and in one individual each of the snakes Pliocercus euryzonus, Imantodes cenchoa, and Nothopsis rugosus. In general, B. dendrobatidis DNA prevalence among reptiles was positively correlated with the infection prevalence among co-occurring anuran amphibians at any particular site (r = 0.88, p = 0.004). These reptiles, therefore, may likely be vectors or reservoir hosts for B. dendrobatidis and could serve as disease transmission agents. Although there is no evidence of B. dendrobatidis disease-induced declines in reptiles, cases of coincidence of reptile and amphibian declines suggest this potentiality. Our study is the first to provide evidence of non-amphibian carriers for B. dendrobatidis in a natural Neotropical environment.},

	Abstract = {The extent to which random processes such as founder events contribute to evolutionary divergence is a long-standing controversy in evolutionary biology. To determine the respective contributions of founder effects and natural selection, we conducted an experiment in which brown anole (Anolis sagrei) lizard populations were established on seven small islands in the Bahamas, from male-female pairs randomly drawn from the same large-island source. These founding events generated significant among-island genetic and morphological differences that persisted throughout the course of the experiment despite all populations adapting in the predicted direction-shorter hindlimbs-in response to the narrower vegetation on the small islands. Thus, using a replicated experiment in nature, we showed that both founder effects and natural selection jointly determine trait values in these populations.},

The new species differs from all other Polychrus species, in that this species has very small dorsal scales and thus a higher number of scales around midbody and in the middorsal line from behind the occipital scales to the level of the posterior edge of the thigh. Furthermore, we redescribe Polychrus peruvianus whose original description is short and lacks information on intraspecific variation and sexual dimorphism. Also, we add some information on intraspecific variation and ecology of Polychrus gutturosus. Finally, we synonymize Polychrus spurrelli Boulenger with Polychrus gutturosus.},

	Abstract = {It is now well documented that androgen and estrogen signaling during early development cause a sexual dimorphism in second-to-fourth digit length ratio (2D:4D). It is also well documented that males of mammalian species have a smaller 2D:4D than females. Although there are discrepancies among 2D:4D studies in birds, the consensus is that birds exhibit the opposite pattern with males having a larger 2D:4D than females. The literature currently lacks substantial information regarding the phylogenetic pattern of this trait in amphibians and reptiles. In this study, we examined 2D:4D in two species of frogs (Oophaga pumilio and Craugastor bransfordii) and two species of lizards (Anolis humilis and Anolis limifrons) to determine the existence and the pattern of the sexual dimorphism. Male O. pumilio and C. bransfordii displayed larger 2D:4D than females in at least one of their two forelimbs. Male A. humilis had larger 2D:4D than females in both hindlimbs, but smaller 2D:4D than females in both forelimbs. Male A. limifrons may also have smaller 2D:4D than females in the right forelimb. Finally, digit ratios were sometimes positively related to body length, suggesting allometric growth. Overall, our results support the existence of the 2D:4D sexual dimorphism in amphibians and lizards and add to the knowledge of 2D:4D trait patterning among tetrapods.},

	Abstract = {Currently available phylogenetic methods for studying the rate of evolution in a continuously valued character assume that the rate is constant throughout the tree or that it changes along specific branches according to an a priori hypothesis of rate variation provided by the user. Herein, we describe a new method for studying evolutionary rate variation in continuously valued characters given an estimate of the phylogenetic history of the species in our study. According to this method, we propose no specific prior hypothesis for how the variation in evolutionary rate is structured throughout the history of the species in our study. Instead, we use a bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to estimate evolutionary rates and the shift point between rates on the tree. We do this by simultaneously sampling rates and shift points in proportion to their posterior probability, and then collapsing the posterior sample into an estimate of the parameters of interest. We use simulation to show that the method is quite successful at identifying the phylogenetic position of a shift in the rate of evolution, and that estimated rates are asymptotically unbiased. We also provide an empirical example of the method using data for Anolis lizards.},

@article{Gilman:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Jumping is a common form of locomotion for many arboreal animals. Many species of the arboreal lizard genus Anolis occupy habitats in which they must jump to and from unsteady perches, e.g. narrow branches, vines, grass and leaves. Anoles therefore often use compliant perches that could alter jump performance. In this study we conducted a small survey of the compliance of perches used by the arboreal green anole Anolis carolinensis in the wild (N=54 perches) and then, using perches within the range of compliances used by this species, investigated how perch compliance (flexibility) affects the key jumping variables jump distance, takeoff duration, takeoff angle, takeoff speed and landing angle in A. carolinensis in the laboratory (N=11). We observed that lizards lost contact with compliant horizontal perches prior to perch recoil, and increased perch compliance resulted in decreased jump distance and takeoff speed, likely because of the loss of kinetic energy to the flexion of the perch. However, the most striking effect of perch compliance was an unexpected one; perch recoil following takeoff resulted in the lizards being struck on the tail by the perch, even on the narrowest perches. This interaction between the perch and the tail significantly altered body positioning during flight and landing. These results suggest that although the use of compliant perches in the wild is common for this species, jumping from these perches is potentially costly and may affect survival and behavior, particularly in the largest individuals.},

	Abstract = {The axial skeleton is a defining feature of vertebrates and is patterned during somitogenesis. Cyclically expressed members of the notch and other signaling pathways, described as the 'segmentation clock', regulate the formation of somite boundaries. Comparisons among vertebrate model systems have revealed fundamental shifts in the regulation of expression among critical genes in the notch pathway. However, insights into the evolution of these expression differences have been limited by the lack of information from non-avian reptiles. We analyzed the segmentation clock of the first Lepidosaurian reptile sequenced, the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, for comparison with avian and mammalian models. Using genomic sequence, RNA-Seq transcriptomic data, and in situ hybridization analysis of somite-stage embryos, we carried out comparative analyses of key genes and found that the anole segmentation clock displays features common to both amniote and anamniote vertebrates. Shared features with anamniotes, represented by Xenopus laevis and Danio rerio, include an absence of lunatic fringe (lfng) expression within the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), a hes6a gradient in the PSM not observed in the chicken or mouse, and EGF repeat structure of the divergent notch ligand, dll3. The anole and mouse share cycling expression of dll1 ligand in the PSM. To gain insight from an Archosaurian reptile, we analysed LFNG and DLL1 expressions in the American alligator. LFNG expression was absent in the alligator PSM, like the anole but unlike the chicken. In contrast, DLL1 expression does not cycle in the PSM of the alligator, similar to the chicken but unlike the anole. Thus, our analysis yields novel insights into features of the segmentation clock that are evolutionarily basal to amniotes versus those that are specific to mammals, Lepidosaurian reptiles, or Archosaurian reptiles.},

@article{Irwin:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Exendins are secretin hormone-like peptides that are components of the toxins from two venomous lizards, Heloderma suspectum (Gila monster) and Heloderma horridium (Mexican bearded lizard). Exendins-1 and -2 are vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-like, both in sequence and function, while exendins-3 and -4 are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-like. The evolutionary origin of these peptides, and the genes that encode them, has been unclear. Recently, genes orthologous to exendin have been identified in reptiles, birds and amphibians. Analysis of the orthologous sequences demonstrates that the Heloderma exendins diversified by gene duplication from a common exendin ancestor on the Heloderma lineage after divergence from other reptiles, including the anole lizard and Burmese python. In addition, the exendin toxin peptide sequences, but not their pro or signal peptides, have evolved very rapidly on the Heloderma lineage, likely as they adapted to their new function as toxins. Exendins-1 and -2 not only evolved rapidly but their sequences have evolved convergently upon that of VIP, resulting in a doubling of its identity with VIP, while exendins-3 and -4 have retained an ancestral property of being more GLP-1-like sequences. These results suggest that the ancestral role of exendin, which is potentially still retained in some species, had greater similarity with proglucagon-derived peptides or GIP.},

	Abstract = {The adaptive landscape and the G-matrix are keys concepts for understanding how quantitative characters evolve during adaptive radiation. In particular, whether the adaptive landscape can drive convergence of phenotypic integration (i.e., the pattern of phenotypic variation and covariation summarized in the P-matrix) is not well studied. We estimated and compared P for 19 morphological traits in eight species of Caribbean Anolis lizards, finding that similarity in P among species was not correlated with phylogenetic distance. However, greater similarity in P among ecologically similar Anolis species (i.e., the trunk-ground ecomorph) suggests the role of convergent natural selection. Despite this convergence and relatively deep phylogenetic divergence, a large portion of eigenstructure of P is retained among our eight focal species. We also analyzed P as an approximation of G to test for correspondence with the pattern of phenotypic divergence in 21 Caribbean Anolis species. These patterns of covariation were coincident, suggesting that either genetic constraint has influenced the pattern of among-species divergence or, alternatively, that the adaptive landscape has influenced both G and the pattern of phenotypic divergence among species. We provide evidence for convergent evolution of phenotypic integration for one class of Anolis ecomorph, revealing yet another important dimension of evolutionary convergence in this group.},

@article{Cohen:2012ac,
	Abstract = {Estrogens are critical for a variety of aspects of brain development and adult processes. These steroids act via receptors within specific tissues. Several estrogen receptors (ER) are thought to exist, including ERalpha and ERbeta, which function via classical, genomic mechanisms. These two ERs are found in a variety of species and are critical to diverse functions, including reproductive behaviors. ERbeta was discovered more recently than ERalpha, and very little work has been done on this receptor in reptiles. Currently no data are available on its distribution in the brain in this vertebrate group. Here, we have cloned ERbeta in the green anole lizard, mapped its distribution using in situ hybridization, and quantified expression in three brain areas controlling reproductive behaviors-the preoptic area, ventromedial amygdala (AMY), and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). ERbeta was detected in discrete areas throughout the anole brain, with high levels in limbic regions and motor nuclei in the brainstem. Females had a greater density of ERbeta positive cells in the AMY and VMH than males. While the functional consequences of these differences are not clear, they may result in an increased ability to respond to local levels of estradiol. The present work documents that neural ERbeta is distributed similarly in reptilian, rodent and avian species, suggesting that it may perform similar roles. However, more work is necessary to elucidate the function of ERbeta in this group.},

	Abstract = {A variety of ecologically important behaviors, including circadian rhythms and seasonal reproduction, are influenced by non-visual responses to light, yet very little is known about the relationship between photic habitat and non-visual photoreception. Puerto Rican Anolis lizards have diverged into multiple photic niches, making them a good model for non-visual photosensory ecology. We investigated the photic induction of locomotor activity, a non-visual response to light, in four species of Anolis comprising two pairs of closely related, ecomorphologically similar species whose microhabitats differ in solar irradiance. We developed a device for continuous, automated detection and recording of anole locomotor activity, and used it to characterize activity under 12:12 h light-dark cycles. Next, we administered a series of 2-h light pulses during the dark period of the light-dark cycle and measured the increase in locomotor activity relative to baseline dark activity. Five different irradiances (ranging from very dim to daytime levels) were given to each individual lizard on separate nights. As expected, light caused an irradiance-dependent increase in locomotor activity in all four species. The responses at the highest irradiances were significantly greater in species occupying relatively more shaded habitats, suggesting that non-visual photoreception may be adapted to habitat light in Anolis lizards.},

@article{Kusumi:2011aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative studies of amniotes have been hindered by a dearth of reptilian molecular sequences. With the genomic assembly of the green anole, Anolis carolinensis available, non-avian reptilian genes can now be compared to mammalian, avian, and amphibian homologs. Furthermore, with more than 350 extant species in the genus Anolis, anoles are an unparalleled example of tetrapod genetic diversity and divergence. As an important ecological, genetic and now genomic reference, it is imperative to develop a standardized Anolis gene nomenclature alongside associated vocabularies and other useful metrics. RESULTS: Here we report the formation of the Anolis Gene Nomenclature Committee (AGNC) and propose a standardized evolutionary characterization code that will help researchers to define gene orthology and paralogy with tetrapod homologs, provide a system for naming novel genes in Anolis and other reptiles, furnish abbreviations to facilitate comparative studies among the Anolis species and related iguanid squamates, and classify the geographical origins of Anolis subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: This report has been generated in close consultation with members of the Anolis and genomic research communities, and using public database resources including NCBI and Ensembl. Updates will continue to be regularly posted to new research community websites such as lizardbase. We anticipate that this standardized gene nomenclature will facilitate the accessibility of reptilian sequences for comparative studies among tetrapods and will further serve as a template for other communities in their sequencing and annotation initiatives.},

	Abstract = {The recent sequencing of the lizard genome provides a unique opportunity to examine the evolution of vertebrate genomes in a phylogenetic context. The lizard genome contains an extraordinary diversity of active transposable elements that far exceeds the diversity reported in extant mammals and birds. Retrotransposons and DNA transposons are represented by multiple active families, contributing to the very diverse repetitive landscape of the lizard. Surprisingly, ancient transposon copies are relatively rare suggesting that the transposon copy number is tightly controlled in lizard. This bias in favor of young copies results from the joint effect of purifying selection acting on novel insertions and a high rate of DNA loss. Recent analyses have revealed that the repetitive landscape of reptiles differ drastically from other extant amniotes by their diversity but also by the dynamics of amplification of their transposons. Thus, from the point of view of mobile elements, reptile genomes show more similarity to fish and amphibians than to other amniotes.},

	Abstract = {After tail loss in lizards no infections occur indicating the presence of an effective anti-microbial barrier in the exposed tissues of the tail stump. Previous molecular studies on the lizard Anolis carolinensis have identified some beta-defensin-like genes and the deduced peptides that may be involved in anti-infective protection. The present study has analyzed the tissues of wounded and normal tails in lizards in order to immune-localize one of the beta-defensins previously found (AcBD15) and to detect variation in its gene expression during wounding. No immunoreactivity for this beta-defensin is present in normal tissues or in the epidermis of lizards, except for some sparse granulocytes. The latter are seen during the first 1-6 days after tail amputation and AcBD15 immunoreactivity is present in their granules. Degenerating granulocytes are incorporated, together with dead erythrocytes, platelets and keratinocytes into the scab. Real time RT-PCR and western blotting analysis indicates up-regulation of AcBD15 expression during wounding with respect to normal tissues, indicating that production, storage and release of this beta-defensin from granulocytes are active following wounding. The production of beta-defensins from granulocytes would allow protection of exposed tissues from microbial invasion avoiding a persistent inflammation, a process that leads to tissue regeneration.},

	Abstract = {Long neglected by classic island biogeographical theory, speciation within and among islands is increasingly recognized as a major contributor to insular diversity. Although the factors responsible for island speciation remain poorly understood, this process appears critically dependent on geographical variation and speciation in allopatry or parapatry. Here, we investigate geographical variation and speciation in a complex of Hispaniolan trunk anoles (Anolis distichus), where populations with strikingly distinct dewlap colours and patterns correspond with deeply divergent mtDNA structure. Using a multilocus, population-level analysis, we investigate whether these phenotypically and mitochondrially distinct populations exhibit the type of nuclear differentiation expected among species or incipient species. Along a transect that extends across a recently recessed marine barrier, our results are consistent with the persistence of an abrupt phenotypic and mitochondrial transition following secondary contact, in spite of little or no evidence for a reduction in nuclear gene flow. Along a second transect extending across a steep environmental gradient, our phenotypic and microsatellite data suggest a sharp genetic break with little or no admixture, whereas mtDNA recovers a signature of extensive unidirectional introgression. Together, these results are consistent with previous studies of Lesser Antillean anoles, suggesting that allopatric divergence alone is insufficient for speciation, whereas reduced gene flow and partial reproductive isolation may accumulate in the presence of ecological gradients.},

	Abstract = {Environmental contamination by energetic compounds is an increasing international concern, although little is known of their accumulation in and affect on wildlife. Reptiles are often good models for contaminants studies due to natural history traits that increase their potential for exposure. We report a study to assess accumulation and effects of octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX, High Melting Explosive) in green anoles (Anolis carolinensis). Acute oral toxicity (LD(50)) was estimated to exceed 2000 mg/kg body weight in adult male and female anoles using a standard up-and-down method. Accumulation of HMX was assessed in adult females via dietary exposure and into eggs by two routes (directly from the soil and via maternal transfer). HMX readily accumulated into adult females in a dose-dependent manner and into eggs following both exposure pathways. However, total HMX in soil-exposed eggs was up to 40-times greater than those exposed via maternal transfer. Although there was a suggestion of an HMX-induced reduction in body weight in adult females, overall there were no effects observed over the 12 week exposure period. The only significant effect on eggs was a 50% reduction in hatching success for eggs exposed to 2000 mg/kg HMX in the soil during incubation. Growth and survival of hatchlings was not affected by HMX exposure. Our results demonstrate that HMX accumulates through the food chain and into eggs from the soil, but likely poses minimal threat to lizards except to hatching success in eggs incubated in soils with HMX levels near maximum environmental concentrations.},

@article{Jusufi:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Animals that fall upside down typically engage in an aerial righting response so as to reorient dorsoventrally. This behavior can be preparatory to gliding or other controlled aerial behaviors and is ultimately necessary for a successful landing. Aerial righting reflexes have been described historically in various mammals such as cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, and primates. The mechanisms whereby such righting can be accomplished depend on the size of the animal and on anatomical features associated with motion of the limbs and body. Here we apply a comparative approach to the study of aerial righting to explore the diverse strategies used for reorientation in midair. We discuss data for two species of lizards, the gecko Hemidactylus platyurus and the anole Anolis carolinensis, as well as for the first instar of the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum, to illustrate size-dependence of this phenomenon and its relevance to subsequent aerial performance in parachuting and gliding animals. Geckos can use rotation of their large tails to reorient their bodies via conservation of angular momentum. Lizards with tails well exceeding snout-vent length, and correspondingly large tail inertia to body inertia ratios, are more effective at creating midair reorientation maneuvers. Moreover, experiments with stick insects, weighing an order of magnitude less than the lizards, suggest that aerodynamic torques acting on the limbs and body may play a dominant role in the righting process for small invertebrates. Both inertial and aerodynamic effects, therefore, can play a role in the control of aerial righting. We propose that aerial righting reflexes are widespread among arboreal vertebrates and arthropods and that they represent an important initial adaptation in the evolution of controlled aerial behavior.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of the amniotic egg was one of the great evolutionary innovations in the history of life, freeing vertebrates from an obligatory connection to water and thus permitting the conquest of terrestrial environments. Among amniotes, genome sequences are available for mammals and birds, but not for non-avian reptiles. Here we report the genome sequence of the North American green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. We find that A. carolinensis microchromosomes are highly syntenic with chicken microchromosomes, yet do not exhibit the high GC and low repeat content that are characteristic of avian microchromosomes. Also, A. carolinensis mobile elements are very young and diverse-more so than in any other sequenced amniote genome. The GC content of this lizard genome is also unusual in its homogeneity, unlike the regionally variable GC content found in mammals and birds. We describe and assign sequence to the previously unknown A. carolinensis X chromosome. Comparative gene analysis shows that amniote egg proteins have evolved significantly more rapidly than other proteins.

	Abstract = {SCAN is a protein domain frequently found at the N termini of proteins encoded by mammalian tandem zinc finger (ZF) genes, whose structure is known to be similar to that of retroviral gag capsid domains and whose multimerization has been proposed as a model for retroviral assembly. We report that the SCAN domain is derived from the C-terminal portion of the gag capsid (CA) protein from the Gmr1-like family of Gypsy/Ty3-like retrotransposons. On the basis of sequence alignments and phylogenetic distributions, we show that the ancestral host SCAN domain (ESCAN for extended SCAN) was exapted from a full-length CA gene from a Gmr1-like retrotransposon at or near the root of the tetrapod animal branch. A truncated variant of ESCAN that corresponds to the annotated SCAN domain arose shortly thereafter and appears to be the only form extant in mammals. The Anolis lizard has a large number of tandem ZF genes with N-terminal ESCAN or SCAN domains. We predict DNA binding sites for all Anolis ESCAN-ZF and SCAN-ZF proteins and demonstrate several highly significant matches to Anolis Gmr1-like sequences, suggesting that at least some of these proteins target retroelements. SCAN is known to mediate protein dimerization, and the CA protein multimerizes to form the core retroviral and retrotransposon capsid structure. We speculate that the SCAN domain originally functioned to target host ZF proteins to retroelement capsids.},

@article{Lim:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Most vertebrates have three paralogous genes with identical intron-exon structures and a high degree of sequence identity that encode mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocase (Ant) proteins, Ant1 (Slc25a4), Ant2 (Slc25a5) and Ant3 (Slc25a6). Recently, we and others identified a fourth mammalian Ant paralog, Ant4 (Slc25a31), with a distinct intron-exon structure and a lower degree of sequence identity. Ant4 was expressed selectively in testis and sperm in adult mammals and was indeed essential for mouse spermatogenesis, but it was absent in birds, fish and frogs. Since Ant2 is X-linked in mammalian genomes, we hypothesized that the autosomal Ant4 gene may compensate for the loss of Ant2 gene expression during male meiosis in mammals. Here we report that the Ant4 ortholog is conserved in green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis) and demonstrate that it is expressed in the anole testis. Further, a degenerate DNA fragment of putative Ant4 gene was identified in syntenic regions of avian genomes, indicating that Ant4 was present in the common amniote ancestor. Phylogenetic analyses suggest an even more ancient origin of the Ant4 gene. Although anole lizards are presumed male (XY) heterogametic, like mammals, copy numbers of the Ant2 as well as its neighboring gene were similar between male and female anole genomes, indicating that the anole Ant2 gene is either autosomal or located in the pseudoautosomal region of the sex chromosomes, in contrast to the case to mammals. These results imply the conservation of Ant4 is not likely simply driven by the sex chromosomal localization of the Ant2 gene and its subsequent inactivation during male meiosis. Taken together with the fact that Ant4 protein has a uniquely conserved structure when compared to other somatic Ant1, 2 and 3, there may be a specific advantage for mammals and lizards to express Ant4 in their male germ cells.},

	Abstract = {The independent evolution of similar morphologies has long been a subject of considerable interest to biologists. Does phenotypic convergence reflect the primacy of natural selection, or does development set the course of evolution by channelling variation in certain directions? Here, we examine the ontogenetic origins of relative limb length variation among Anolis lizard habitat specialists to address whether convergent phenotypes have arisen through convergent developmental trajectories. Despite the numerous developmental processes that could potentially contribute to variation in adult limb length, our analyses reveal that, in Anolis lizards, such variation is repeatedly the result of changes occurring very early in development, prior to formation of the cartilaginous long bone anlagen.},

@article{Warner:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Moisture availability is critical for successful embryonic development in many organisms. In most oviparous reptiles, for example, water exchange between eggs and the surrounding environment can have substantial fitness consequences, but regulation of this process is unclear. Here, we evaluate whether water uptake by eggs of the lizard Anolis sagrei is regulated by the presence of a live embryo or is a passive hydraulic response to substrate moisture conditions. Many eggs laid in our captive colony were infertile or contained embryos that died during early stages of development, yet these 'dead' eggs continued to gain mass similar to that of 'live' eggs at least during the first half of incubation. Our results suggest that water uptake by eggs is largely a passive hydraulic process during the first half of incubation, but active regulation by embryos may be necessary during latter stages. Maternal effects (e.g., deposition of salts into yolk) could influence this passive process during early incubation.},

	Abstract = {Among closely related taxa, proteins involved in reproduction generally evolve more rapidly than other proteins. Here, we apply a functional and comparative genomics approach to compare functional divergence across a deep phylogenetic array of egg-laying and live-bearing vertebrate taxa. We aligned and annotated a set of 4,986 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 orthologs in Anolis carolinensis (green lizard), Danio rerio (zebrafish), Xenopus tropicalis (frog), Gallus gallus (chicken), and Mus musculus (mouse) according to function using ESTs from available reproductive (including testis and ovary) and non-reproductive tissues as well as Gene Ontology. For each species lineage, genes were further classified as tissue-specific (found in a single tissue) or tissue-expressed (found in multiple tissues). Within independent vertebrate lineages, we generally find that gonadal-specific genes evolve at a faster rate than gonadal-expressed genes and significantly faster than non-reproductive genes. Among the gonadal set, testis genes are generally more diverged than ovary genes. Surprisingly, an opposite but nonsignificant pattern is found among the subset of orthologs that remained functionally conserved across all five lineages. These contrasting evolutionary patterns found between functionally diverged and functionally conserved reproductive orthologs provide evidence for pervasive and potentially cryptic lineage-specific selective processes on ancestral reproductive systems in vertebrates.},

	Abstract = {The Dactyloa clade, one of two major subgroups of mainland Anolis lizards, is distributed from Costa Rica to Peru, including the Amazon region and the southern Lesser Antilles. We estimated the phylogenetic relationships within Dactyloa based on mitochondrial (ND2, five transfer-RNAs, COI) and nuclear (RAG1) gene regions using likelihood and Bayesian methods under different partition strategies. In addition, we tested the monophyly of five previously recognized groups within Dactyloa. The data strongly support the monophyly of Dactyloa and five major clades: eastern, latifrons, Phenacosaurus, roquet and western, each of which exhibits a coherent geographic range. Relationships among the five major clades are less clear: support for basal nodes within Dactyloa is weak and some contradictory relationships are supported by different datasets and/or phylogenetic methods. Of the previously recognized subgroups within Dactyloa, only the roquet series consistently passed the topology tests applied. The monophyly of the aequatorialis, latifrons (as traditionally circumscribed) and punctatus series was strongly rejected, and the monophyly of Phenacosaurus (as traditionally circumscribed) yielded mixed results. The results of the phylogenetic analyses suggest the need for a revised taxonomy and have implications for the biogeography and tempo of the Dactyloa radiation.},

@article{Fujita:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Isochores are large regions of relatively homogeneous nucleotide composition and are present in the genomes of all mammals and birds that have been sequenced to date. The newly sequenced genome of Anolis carolinensis provides the first opportunity to quantify isochore structure in a nonavian reptile. We find Anolis to have the most compositionally homogeneous genome of all amniotes sequenced thus far, a homogeneity exceeding that for the frog Xenopus. Based on a Bayesian algorithm, Anolis has smaller and less GC-rich isochores compared with human and chicken. Correlates generally associated with GC-rich isochores, including shorter introns and higher gene density, have all but disappeared from the Anolis genome. Using genic GC as a proxy for isochore structure so as to compare with other vertebrates, we found that GC content has substantially decreased in the lineage leading to Anolis since diverging from the common ancestor of Reptilia approximately 275 Ma, perhaps reflecting weakened or reversed GC-biased gene conversion, a nonadaptive substitution process that is thought to be important in the maintenance and trajectory of isochore evolution. Our results demonstrate that GC composition in Anolis is not associated with important features of genome structure, including gene density and intron size, in contrast to patterns seen in mammal and bird genomes.},

@article{Townsend:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Iguanian lizards form a diverse clade whose members have been the focus of many comparative studies of ecology, behavior, and evolution. Despite the importance of phylogeny to such studies, interrelationships among many iguanian clades remain uncertain. Within the Old World clade Acrodonta, Agamidae is sometimes found to be paraphyletic with respect to Chamaeleonidae, and recent molecular studies have produced conflicting results for many major clades. Within the largely New World clade Pleurodonta, relationships among the 12 currently recognized major subclades (mostly ranked as families) have been largely unresolved or poorly supported in previous studies. To clarify iguanian evolutionary history, we first infer phylogenies using concatenated maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses of DNA sequence data from 29 nuclear protein-coding genes for 47 iguanian and 29 outgroup taxa. We then estimate a relaxed-clock Bayesian chronogram for iguanians using BEAST. All three methods produce identical topologies. Within Acrodonta, we find strong support for monophyly of Agamidae with respect to Chamaeleonidae, and for almost all relationships within agamids. Within Pleurodonta, we find strong Bayesian support for almost all relationships, and strong ML support for some interfamilial relationships and for monophyly of almost all families (excepting Polychrotidae). Our phylogenetic results suggest a non-traditional biogeographic scenario in which pleurodonts originated in the Northern Hemisphere and subsequently spread southward into South America. The pleurodont portion of the tree is characterized by several very short, deep branches, raising the possibility of deep coalescences that may confound concatenated analyses. We therefore also use 27 of these genes to implement a coalescent-based species-tree approach for pleurodonts. Although this analysis strongly supports monophyly of the pleurodont families, interfamilial relationships are generally different from those in the concatenated tree, and support is uniformly poor. However, a species-tree analysis using only the seven most variable loci yields higher support and more congruence with the concatenated tree. This suggests that low support in the 27-gene species-tree analysis may be an artifact of the many loci that are uninformative for very short branches. This may be a general problem for the application of species-tree methods to rapid radiations, even with phylogenomic data sets. Finally, we correct the non-monophyly of Polychrotidae by recognizing the pleurodont genus Anolis (sensu lato) as a separate family (Dactyloidae), and we correct the non-monophyly of the agamid genus Physignathus by resurrection of the genus Istiurus for the former Physignathus lesueurii.},

@article{Moore:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, is important for regulating circadian rhythms in many animals. Light at night causes an acute suppression of melatonin in nearly all vertebrate species. A previous study found that light failed to suppress melatonin in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. This is a surprising result given that the Anolis pineal gland is intrinsically photosensitive, is a key pacemaker controlling locomotor activity, and can be directly entrained to a light-dark cycle. To find out if the lack of photic suppression is widespread in the Anolis genus, we investigated the acute effects of light on melatonin secretion in five different species of Anolis using flow-through tissue culture. We administered a two-hour pulse of bright light to isolated pineal glands during the night. The results show photic suppression of melatonin in all five Anolis species, but the suppression is weak relative to that seen in other vertebrates. Moreover, Anolis species differ in the magnitude of the effect. These findings are discussed in the context of vertebrate pineal evolution and the ecology of Anolis lizards. Given their extensive phylogenetic and ecological divergence, Anolis lizards provide a promising system for investigating the ecology and evolution of circadian organization.},

@article{Leal:2012ab,
	Abstract = {The role of behavioural flexibility in responding to new or changing environmental challenges is a central theme in cognitive ecology. Studies of behavioural flexibility have focused mostly on mammals and birds because theory predicts that behavioural flexibility is favoured in species or clades that exploit a diversity of habitats or food sources and/or have complex social structure, attributes not associated with ectothermic vertebrates. Here, we present the results of a series of experiments designed to test cognitive abilities across multiple cognitive modules in a tropical arboreal lizard: Anolis evermanni. This lizard shows behavioural flexibility across multiple cognitive tasks, including solving a novel motor task using multiple strategies and reversal learning, as well as rapid associative learning. This flexibility was unexpected because lizards are commonly believed to have limited cognitive abilities and highly stereotyped behaviour. Our findings indicate that the cognitive abilities of A. evermanni are comparable with those of some endothermic species that are recognized to be highly flexible, and strongly suggest a re-thinking of our understanding of the cognitive abilities of ectothermic tetrapods and of the factors favouring the evolution of behavioural flexibility.},

	Abstract = {Diversity is a property of community that can described, characterized, and understood according to the functioning of ecosystems. To study the richness and local abundance and species replacement between habitats around the Zapatosa's wetland complex (El Cesar Department), I carried out four field trips between November of 2006 and October of 2007. A total of 640 sampling hours/man analyzed five habitat types chasmophyte forest, dry forest, riparian forest, palm-grove and tree-lined savanna; with the exception of the palm-grove sampled at its 75%, the others were sampled up to their 80%. I found 847 reptiles that were distributed in 48 species. The group with the highest number of species was Colubridae with 14, followed by Gekkonidae with five. Five endemic species and eight with some conservation threat grade at a national level are reported. The riparian forest was the richest and most abundant habitat with 34 species and 196 individuals. For each habitat, Colubridae had the highest number of species, followed by the families Polychrotidae, Gekkonidae and Teiidae, in that order. The reptile species composition was not different between the tree-lined savanna and the chasmophyte forest, but differed among the tree-lined savanna and the riparian forest, palm-grove and dry forest habitats. The most important differences in the species composition among almost all the habitats were influenced by the species Anolis tropidogaster and Gonatodes albogularis, and the higher occurrence of Stenocercus erythrogaster in the chasmophyte forest. The species replacement had an average value of 50%; the biggest amounts of shared species were the lizards, while the snake Leptodeira septentrionalis was the only one present in all habitat types. The forest grows-among-rocks showed the biggest complementarity and number of unique species compared to the other habitats. The wetland complex provides two thirds of the reptile's species reported until now for the Caribbean region, and more than 80% of those reported for the El Cesar department. This wetland complex seems to behave as a center for low land species concentration as it hosts a high proportion of species from those places.},

	Abstract = {Malaria parasites in the genus Plasmodium have been classified primarily on the basis of differences in morphology. These single-celled organisms often lack distinguishing morphological features, and this can encumber both species delimitation and identification. Six saurian malaria parasites have been described from the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. All six infect lizards in the genus Anolis, but only two of these parasites can be distinguished using morphology. The remaining four species overlap in morphology and geography, and cannot be consistently identified using traditional methods. We compared a morphological approach with a molecular phylogenetic approach for assessing the taxonomy of these parasites. We surveyed for blood parasites from 677 Anolis lizards, representing 26 Anolis spp. from a total of 52 sites across Hispaniola. Fifty-five of these lizards were infected with Plasmodium spp., representing several new host records, but only 24 of these infections could be matched to previously described species using traditional morphological criteria. We then estimated the phylogeny of these parasites using both mitochondrial (cytb and coxI) and nuclear (EF2) genes, and included carefully selected GenBank sequences to confirm identities for certain species. Our molecular results unambiguously corroborated our morphology-based species identifications for only the two species previously judged to be morphologically distinctive. The remaining infections fell into two well-supported and reciprocally monophyletic clades, which contained the morphological variation previously reported for all four of the morphologically ambiguous species. One of these clades was identified as Plasmodium floridense and the other as Plasmodium fairchildi hispaniolae. We elevate the latter to Plasmodium hispaniolae comb. nov. because it is polyphyletic with the mainland species Plasmodium fairchildifairchildi and we contribute additional morphological and molecular characters for future species delimitation. Our phylogenetic hypotheses indicate that two currently recognised taxa, Plasmodium minasense anolisi and Plasmodium tropiduri caribbense, are not valid on Hispaniola. These results illustrate that molecular data can improve taxonomic hypotheses in Plasmodium when reliable morphological characters are lacking.},

This snake is a common, widespread, nonvenomous North American species that has served as a model for diverse studies in evolutionary biology, physiology, genomics, behavior and coevolution. The anole lizard is currently the only genome sequence available for a non-avian reptile. Thus, the garter snake at this time would be the first available snake genome sequence and as such would provide much needed comparative representation of non-avian reptilian genomes, and would also allow critical new insights for vertebrate comparative genomic studies. We outline the major areas of discovery that the availability of the garter snake genome would enable, and describe a plan for whole-genome sequencing.},

@article{Denver:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Leptin, the protein product of the obese(ob or Lep) gene, is a hormone synthesized by adipocytes that signals available energy reserves to the brain, and thereby influences development, growth, metabolism and reproduction. In mammals, leptin functions as an adiposity signal: circulating leptin fluctuates in proportion to fat mass, and it acts on the hypothalamus to suppress food intake. Orthologs of mammalian Lep genes were recently isolated from several fish and two amphibian species, and here we report the identification of two Lep genes in a reptile, the lizard Anolis carolinensis. While vertebrate leptins show large divergence in their primary amino acid sequence, they form similar tertiary structures, and may have similar potencies when tested in vitro on heterologous leptin receptors (LepRs). Leptin binds to LepRs on the plasma membrane, activating several intracellular signaling pathways. Vertebrate LepRs signal via the Janus kinase (Jak) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway. Three tyrosine residues located within the LepR cytoplasmic domain are phosphorylated by Jak2 and are required for activation of SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2, STAT5 and STAT3 signaling. These tyrosines are conserved from fishes to mammals, demonstrating their critical role in signaling by the LepR. Leptin is anorexigenic in representatives of all vertebrate classes, suggesting that its role in energy balance is ancient and has been evolutionarily conserved. In addition to its integral role as a regulator of appetite and energy balance, leptin exerts pleiotropic actions in development, physiology and behavior.},

Through the analysis of the green lizard (Anolis carolinensis) genome and the expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries 32 beta-defensin-like-peptides have been identified. The level of expression of some of these genes in different tissues has been determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Gene expression and structure analysis suggest the presence of alternative splicing mechanisms, with a number of exons ranging from two to four, similar to that for beta-defensins genes in mammals. Lizard beta-defensin-like peptides present the characteristic cysteine-motif identified in mammalian and avian beta-defensins. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that some lizard beta-defensins-like peptides are related to crotamine and crotamin-like peptides of snakes and lizards suggesting that beta-defensins and venomous peptides have a common ancestor gene.},

@article{Kuo:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Locomotor performance is a crucial determinant of organismal fitness but is often impaired in certain circumstances, such as increased mass (loading) resulting from feeding or gravidity. Although the effects of loading have been studied extensively for striding locomotion, its effects on jumping are poorly understood. Jumping is a mode of locomotion that is widely used across animal taxa. It demands large amounts of power over a short time interval and, consequently, may be affected by loading to a greater extent than other modes of locomotion. We placed artificial loads equal to 30% body mass on individuals of the species Anolis carolinensis to simulate the mass gain following the consumption of a large meal. We investigated the effects of loading on jump performance (maximum jump distance and accuracy), kinematics and power output. Loading caused a significant 18% decline in maximum jump distance and a significant 10% decline in takeoff speed. In other words, the presence of the load caused the lizards to take shorter and slower jumps, whereas takeoff angle and takeoff duration were not affected. By contrast, jump accuracy was unaffected by loading, although accuracy declined when lizards jumped to farther perches. Finally, mass-specific power output did not increase significantly when lizards jumped with loads, suggesting that the ability to produce mechanical power may be a key limiting factor for maximum jump performance. Our results suggest that mass gain after a large meal can pose a significant locomotor challenge and also imply a tradeoff between fulfilling energy requirement and moving efficiently in the environment.},

	Abstract = {Laboratory studies of reproductive systems have long supported the idea that neural and/or muscular structures used frequently are often enhanced in size. However, field studies integrating behavioral, morphological, and hormonal data are needed to better understand relationships in natural environments. We examined a natural population of green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) to determine whether variation in reproductive morphology both within and between the sexes paralleled differences in courtship and copulatory behaviors and circulating testosterone levels. Display rate in males was positively correlated with the sizes of the cartilage supporting the dewlap (a throat fan used in courtship and aggression) and renal sex segments (portions of the kidney that function similarly to the mammalian prostate), but correlated negatively with seminiferous tubule size. Plasma testosterone in males was negatively correlated with display behavior and was not correlated with any measures of morphology. Females, which display rarely, exhibited no relationships between morphology and frequency of behavior. Comparisons between the sexes show that males have consistently larger courtship and copulation morphologies than females, even when accounting for sex differences in body size. The results not only support the idea of relationships between increased function and enhanced structures, but also show the complexity of mechanistic interactions associated with reproductive behavior in wild animals.},

	Abstract = {Since first being proposed as a tandem gene family in 2001, the relatedness of the 5 SIBLING proteins (BSP, DMP1, DSPP, MEPE, and SPP1/OPN) has predominantly depended on arguments involving shared intron/exon properties as well as conserved protein biochemical properties (e.g. unstructured and acidic) and specific peptide motifs (e.g. phosphorylation and integrin-binding RGD). This report discusses the evidence that an ancient DMP1 gene underwent a simple duplication in the common ancestor of mammals and reptiles and then separately evolved into DSPP-like paralogs in the 2 classes. Genomic sequence analyses show that different copies of the original DMP1 duplication process were selected by mammalian and reptilian (anole lizard) classes to acquire genetically different but biochemically similar phosphoserine-rich repeat domains by convergent evolution. Mammals, for example, expanded phosphoserine motifs encoded exclusively using motifs containing AGC/T serine codons while the reptile line's repeats also used TCN-encoding serine codons. A similar analysis of the origins of the other 4 SIBLINGs will require even more detailed analysis as genome sequences of various fish and amphibia become available.},

	Abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity can contribute to the process of adaptive radiation by facilitating population persistence in novel environments. West Indian Anolis lizards provide a classic example of an adaptive radiation, in which divergence has occurred along two primary ecological axes: structural microhabitat and climate. Adaptive plasticity in limb morphology is hypothesized to have facilitated divergence along the structural niche axis in Anolis, but very little work has explored plasticity in physiological traits. Here, we experimentally ask whether Puerto Rican Anolis cristatellus from mesic and xeric habitats differ in desiccation rates, and whether these lizards exhibit an acclimation response to changes in relative humidity. We first present microclimatic data collected at lizard perch sites that demonstrate that abiotic conditions experienced by lizards differ between mesic and xeric habitat types. In Experiment 1, we measured desiccation rates of lizards from both habitats maintained under identical laboratory conditions. This experiment demonstrated that desiccation rates differ between populations; xeric lizards lose water more slowly than mesic lizards. In Experiment 2, lizards from each habitat were either maintained under the conditions of Experiment 1, or under extremely low relative humidity. Desiccation rates did not differ between lizards from the same habitat maintained under different treatments and xeric lizards maintained lower desiccation rates than mesic lizards within each treatment. Our results demonstrate that A. cristatellus does not exhibit an acclimation response to abrupt changes of hydric conditions, and suggest that tropical Anolis lizards might be unable to exhibit physiological plasticity in desiccation rates in response to varying climatic conditions.},

@article{Kodali:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Under the shell of a chicken egg are two opposed proteinaceous disulfide-rich membranes. They are fabricated in the avian oviduct using fibers formed from proteins that are extensively coupled by irreversible lysine-derived crosslinks. The intractability of these eggshell membranes (ESM) has slowed their characterization and their protein composition remains uncertain. In this work, reductive alkylation of ESM followed by proteolytic digestion led to the identification of a cysteine rich ESM protein (abbreviated CREMP) that was similar to spore coat protein SP75 from cellular slime molds. Analysis of the cysteine repeats in partial sequences of CREMP reveals runs of remarkably repetitive patterns. Module a contains a C-X(4)-C-X(5)-C-X(8)-C-X(6) pattern (where X represents intervening non-cysteine residues). These inter-cysteine amino acid residues are also strikingly conserved. The evolutionarily-related module b has the same cysteine spacing as a, but has 11 amino acid residues at its C-terminus. Different stretches of CREMP sequences in chicken genomic DNA fragments show diverse repeat patterns: e.g. all a modules; an alternation of a-b modules; or an a-b-b arrangement. Comparable CREMP proteins are found in contigs of the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and in the oviparous green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). In all these cases the long runs of highly conserved modular repeats have evidently led to difficulties in the assembly of full length DNA sequences. Hence the number, and the amino acid lengths, of CREMP proteins are currently unknown. A 118 amino acid fragment (representing an a-b-a-b pattern) from a chicken oviduct EST library expressed in Escherichia coli is a well folded, highly anisotropic, protein with a large chemical shift dispersion in 2D solution NMR spectra. Structure is completely lost on reduction of the 8 disulfide bonds of this protein fragment. Finally, solid state NMR spectra suggest a surprising degree of order in intact ESM fibers.},

	Abstract = {We studied the distribution of lipid material and organelles in the epidermal layers of toe pads from two species of lizards representing the two main lizard families in which adhesive scansors are found (gekkonids and polychrotids), the dull day gecko, Phelsuma dubia and the green anole, Anolis carolinensis. Although lipids are a conspicuous component of the mesos layer of squamate reptiles and function in reducing cutaneous water loss, their distribution has not been specifically studied in the highly elaborated epidermal surface of adhesive toe pads. We found that, in addition to the typical cutaneous water loss-resistant mesos and alpha-layer lipids, the Oberhutchen (including the setae) on the most exterior layers of the epidermis in P. dubia and A. carolinensis also contain lipid material. We also present detailed histochemical and ultrastructural analyses of the toe pads of P. dubia, which indicate that lipid material is closely associated spatially with maturing setae as they branch during the renewal phase of epidermal regeneration. This lipid material appears associated with the packing of keratin within setae, possibly affecting permeability to water loss in the pad lamella, where the surface area is from 4-60-fold greater compared with normal scales.},

@article{Seligmann:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Codon-anticodon mismatches and tRNA misloadings cause translational amino acid misinsertions, producing dysfunctional proteins. Here I explore the original hypothesis whether mismatches tend to compensate misacylation, so as to insert the amino acid coded by the codon. This error compensation is promoted by the fact that codon-anticodon mismatch stabilities increase with tRNA misacylation potentials (predicted by 'tfam') by non-cognate amino acids coded by the mismatched codons for most tRNAs examined. Error compensation is independent of preferential misacylation by non-cognate amino acids physico-chemically similar to cognate amino acids, a phenomenon that decreases misinsertion impacts. Error compensation correlates negatively with (a) codon/anticodon abundance (in human mitochondria and Escherichia coli); (b) developmental instability (estimated by fluctuating asymmetry in bilateral counts of subdigital lamellae, in each of two lizard genera, Anolis and Sceloporus); and (c) pathogenicity of human mitochondrial tRNA polymorphisms. Patterns described here suggest that tRNA misacylation is sometimes compensated by codon-anticodon mismatches. Hence translation inserts the amino acid coded by the mismatched codon, despite mismatch and misloading. Results suggest that this phenomenon is sufficiently important to affect whole organism phenotypes, as shown by correlations with pathologies and morphological estimates of developmental stability.},

@article{Poe:2011aa,
	Abstract = {The distributions and characteristics of naturalized species may be explained by novel anthropogenous aspects of world biogeography such as the creation of favorable transport environments for propagules on ships. Conversely, the unprecedented connectivity of humans may simply accelerate omnipresent ecological and evolutionary forces, for example, ships may allow species that are generally good dispersers to disperse more quickly. As a null hypothesis, there may be no human component to species naturalization. The first hypothesis predicts that naturalized species will possess unusual characteristics specific to interactions with humans. The latter two hypotheses predict similarity between ancient colonizers and recently naturalized species. In this article, we present a test of the latter hypotheses and show how they may be reconciled with the former. We show that species of Anolis lizard that are ancient solitary colonizers share characteristics of size, shape, scalation, and phylogeny with naturalized species of Anolis. Characteristics of ancient solitary colonizers predict naturalization approximately as well as characteristics of naturalized species themselves. These results suggest the existence of a general colonizing type of Anolis, and that contemporary patterns of naturalization are at least partially explained by abilities that are unrelated to interactions with humans.},

In particular, mining expressed tag sequences (EST) for microsatellites and developing conserved cross-species microsatellite markers can provide a rapid and relatively inexpensive method to develop new markers for a range of species. Here, we adopt this approach to develop cross-species microsatellite markers in Anolis lizards, which is a model genus in evolutionary biology and ecology. Using EST sequences from Anolis carolinensis, we identified 127 microsatellites that satisfied our criteria, and tested 49 of these in five species of Anolis (carolinensis, distichus, apletophallus, porcatus and sagrei). We identified between 8 and 25 new variable genetic markers for five Anolis species. These markers will be a valuable resource for studies of population genetics, comparative mapping, mating systems, behavioural ecology and adaptive radiations in this diverse lineage.},

@article{Gaunt:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Cdx1, an upstream regulator of Hox genes, is best characterized for its homeotic effects upon the developing axial skeleton, particularly in the neck. It responds to retinoic acid (RA) in both mouse embryos and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. By use of beta-galactosidase chemiluminescence, we show that a mouse Cdx1/lacZ reporter expressed in P19 EC cells responds to RA by the combined activities of an intron retinoic acid response element (RARE) and an upstream RARE. In contrast, a chicken Cdx1/lacZ reporter responds only by activity of the intron RARE. Database analyses upon Cdx1 from twenty three vertebrate species reveal that the intron RARE is structurally conserved in amniotes (eutherian mammals, marsupials, birds and Anole lizard), but not in Xenopus or fish. The upstream RARE is structurally conserved only in eutherian mammals. We conclude that the intron RARE originated at around the amphibian/amniote division, and the upstream RARE appeared around the marsupial/eutherian mammal division. In view of the site of action of Cdx1, we propose that acquisition of the intron RARE may have facilitated the substantial changes that occurred in the neck and anterior thorax at the advent of the amniotes. We present evidence that Cdx1 is also a developmental regulator of the female urogenital system, and we suggest that acquisition of the upstream RARE may have contributed to morphological divergence of marsupial and eutherian mammals.},

	Abstract = {Among ectotherms, individuals raised in cooler temperatures often have larger body size and/or larger cell size. The current study tested whether geographic variation in cell size and plasticity for cell size exist in a terrestrial, ectothermic vertebrate, Anolis carolinensis Voigt, 1832. We demonstrated temperature-induced plasticity in erythrocytes and epithelial cells of hatchlings lizards derived from the eggs of females sampled from four populations and incubated at multiple temperatures. Larger cells were produced in hatchlings from cooler treatments; however, hatchling body size was unaffected by temperature. Therefore, temperature-induced plasticity applies at the cellular, but not organismal, level in A. carolinensis. In addition, reaction norms for cell size differed among populations. There was a latitudinal trend in cell size and in plasticity of cell size among our study populations. The two southernmost populations showed plasticity in cell size, whereas the two northernmost ones did not. We suggest that selection pressure for larger cell size in northern, cooler environments has restricted plasticity in A. carolinensis applied at the cellular level in response to variable incubation environments.},

	Abstract = {Many organisms invariably produce one offspring per reproductive bout, but experimental tests of adaptive explanations for this reproductive pattern are rare. To address this issue, we studied a lizard (Anolis sagrei) that produces one egg at a time to test the hypothesis that solitary incubation (due to single-egg clutches) eliminates competition with adjacent eggs for moisture and thus enhances offspring quality via increased egg water uptake during development. Our findings suggest that solitary incubation does not affect rates of moisture uptake by eggs or offspring size. However, egg moisture uptake and offspring size were negatively affected when eggs were adjacent to an egg that died during development. Depending on rates of infertile eggs or embryo mortality in the field, single-egg clutches may improve developmental environments and enhance offspring fitness. These results highlight the importance of considering the role of plastic embryonic responses during development in explaining reproductive patterns.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary consequences of anthropogenic change is an emerging topic in evolutionary biology. While highly sensitive species may go extinct in response to anthropogenic habitat alteration, those with broader environmental tolerances may persist and adapt to the changes. Here, we use morphological data from the brown anole (Anolis sagrei), a lizard species that lives in both natural and human-disturbed habitats, to examine the impact of anthropogenic habitat alteration. We find populations inhabiting disturbed habitats were significantly larger in snout-vent length, hindspan, and mass and provide evidence that the observed divergence in hindspan is driven by human-induced changes in habitat structure. Populations were found to be genetically distinct among islands but are not genetically differentiated between habitat types on islands. Thus, the observed pattern of intra-island morphological differences cannot be explained by separate founding populations. Rather, our results are consistent with morphological differences between habitats having arisen in situ on each island. Results underscore the significant impact anthropogenic change may have on evolutionary trajectories of populations that persist in human-altered habitats.},

@article{Alibardi:2011ab,
	Abstract = {The claw of lizards is largely composed of beta-keratins, also referred to as keratin-associated beta-proteins. Recently, we have reported that the genome of the lizard Anolis carolinensis contains alpha keratin genes homologous to hair keratins typical of hairs and claws of mammals. Molecular and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that two hair keratin homologs named hard acid keratin 1 (HA1) and hard basic keratin 1 (HB1) are expressed in keratinocytes forming the claws of A. carolinensis. Here, we extended the immunocytochemical localization of the novel reptilian keratins to the ultrastructural level. After sectioning, claws were subjected to immunogold labeling using antibodies against HA1, HB1, and, for comparison, beta-keratins. Electron microscopy showed that the randomly organized network of tonofilaments in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes becomes organized in long and parallel bundles of keratin in precorneous layers, resembling cortical cells of hairs. Entering the cornified part of the claw, the elongated corneous cells fuse and accumulate corneous material. HA1 and HB1 are absent in the basal layer and lower spinosus layers of the claw and are expressed in the upper and precorneous layers, including the elongating corneocytes. The labeling for alpha-keratin was loosely associated with filament structures forming the fibrous framework of the claws. The ultrastructural distribution pattern of hard alpha-keratins resembled that of beta-keratins, which is compatible with the hypothesis of an interaction during claw morphogenesis. The data on the ultrastructural localization of hair keratin homologs facilitate a comparison of lizard claws and mammalian hard epidermal appendages containing hair keratins.},

@article{Storz:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Tetrapod vertebrates possess multiple alpha- and beta-like globin genes that are ontogenetically regulated, such that functionally distinct hemoglobin (Hb) isoforms are synthesized during different stages of development. The alpha- and beta-like globin genes of amphibians, birds and mammals are differentially expressed during embryonic development and postnatal life, but little is known about the developmental regulation of globin gene expression in non-avian reptiles. Here we report an investigation into the developmental regulation of Hb synthesis in the green anole lizard Anolis carolinensis. We tested two hypotheses derived from comparative genomic studies of the globin gene clusters in tetrapod vertebrates. First, we tested whether the product of the Anolis alpha(D)-globin gene is incorporated into embryonic Hb, thereby performing the role that would normally be performed by the embyronic alpha(E)-globin gene (which has been deleted from the green anole genome). Second, we tested whether two 'lizard-specific' beta-globin paralogs have independently evolved a division of labor between an early-expressed embryonic gene and a later-expressed adult gene. Results of a proteomic analysis revealed that alpha- and beta-like globin genes of the anole are differentially expressed during embryonic development. However, the same repertoire of alpha- and beta-chain Hb isoforms was expressed during all stages of development and postnatal life, and the ontogenetic shifts in isoform composition were relatively subtle. In contrast to the pattern that has been documented in other tetrapod vertebrates, it appears that the developmental regulation of Hb synthesis in the green anole lizard does not involve discrete, stage-specific switches in gene activation and gene silencing.},

	Abstract = {Escape by Anolis lizards is influenced by microhabitats and fight initiation distance increases with predation risk. Differences in microhabitat use among ecomorphs affect escape behavior, but only two studies have reported ecomorphological differences in flight initiation distance among Greater Antillean species. I studied effects of predation risk and microhabitats on escape behavior by conducting field experiments using two species of anoles, Anolis lineatopus and A. grahami, on the campus of the University of the West Indies at Mona, Jamaica. Because ecomorphological variation of anoles has evolved independently within each island of the Greater Antilles, but relationships between ecomorphs and escape behaviors are poorly known, I characterized microhabitat use and escape tactics, and determined relationships between flight initiation distance and two risk factors, habituation to human presence and perch height, in Anolis lineatopus, a trunk-ground anole and A. grahami, a trunk-crown anole. Sample sizes for A. lineatopus and A. grahami were 214 and 93, for microhabitat use and escape destinations, 74 and 34 for human presence and 125 and 34 for perch height. The two species occurred in similar microhabitats and exhibited similar escape tactics, but exhibited key differences expected for their ecomorphs. Both species were sighted frequently on the ground and on trees, but A. lineatopus were more frequently on ground and were perched lower than A. grahami. Both species escaped from ground to trees and when on trees hid on far sides and escaped without changing climbing direction with equal frequency. The frequency of fleeing upward was greater for A. grahami than A. lineatopus. Both species exhibited habituation by having shorter flight initiation distances in areas with more frequent exposure to people. In both species flight initiation distance increased as perch height decreased because, lizards had to climb farther to be out of reach when perched lower. The relationship between flight initiation distance and perch height may apply to other anole ecomorphs that flee upward when low perched on trees.},

	Abstract = {Many noncoding regions of genomes appear to be essential to genome function. Conservation of large numbers of noncoding sequences has been reported repeatedly among mammals but not thus far among birds and reptiles. By searching genomes of chicken (Gallus gallus), zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and green anole (Anolis carolinensis), we quantified the conservation among birds and reptiles and across amniotes of long, conserved noncoding sequences (LCNS), which we define as sequences >/=500 bp in length and exhibiting >/=95% similarity between species. We found 4,294 LCNS shared between chicken and zebra finch and 574 LCNS shared by the two birds and Anolis. The percent of genomes comprised by LCNS in the two birds (0.0024%) is notably higher than the percent in mammals (<0.0003% to <0.001%), differences that we show may be explained in part by differences in genome-wide substitution rates. We reconstruct a large number of LCNS for the amniote ancestor (ca. 8,630) and hypothesize differential loss and substantial turnover of these sites in descendent lineages. By contrast, we estimated a small role for recruitment of LCNS via acquisition of novel functions over time. Across amniotes, LCNS are significantly enriched with transcription factor binding sites for many developmental genes, and 2.9% of LCNS shared between the two birds show evidence of expression in brain expressed sequence tag databases. These results show that the rate of retention of LCNS from the amniote ancestor differs between mammals and Reptilia (including birds) and that this may reflect differing roles and constraints in gene regulation.},

	Abstract = {We have recently shown that homologs of mammalian hair keratins are expressed in the claws of the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. To test whether reptilian hair keratin homologs are functionally associated with claws, we investigated the conservation of the prototypical reptilian hair keratin homolog, hard acidic keratin 1 (HA1), in representative species from all main clades of reptiles. A complete cDNA of HA1 was cloned from the claw-forming epidermis of the lacertid lizard Podarcis sicula, and partial HA1 gene sequences could be amplified from genomic DNA of tuatara, lizards, gekkos, turtles, and crocodiles. In contrast, the HA1 gene of the limbless slow worm, Anguis fragilis, and of two species of turtles contained at least one deleterious mutation. Moreover, an HA1 gene was undetectable in the softshell turtle, snakes, and birds. Mapping the presence and absence of HA1 onto the phylogenetic tree of sauropsids suggested that the HA1 gene has been lost independently in several lineages of reptiles. The species distribution of HA1 is compatible with the hypothesis of a primary function of HA1 in claws but also shows that the formation of reptilian claws does not strictly depend on this keratin.},

	Abstract = {The Activation Induced Deaminase (AID)/APOBEC family of deaminases targeting nucleic acids arose at the beginning of the vertebrate radiation and further expanded in mammals. Following an analysis of the available genomic data, we report the identification of the APOBEC5, a novel group of paralogues in tetrapods. Moreover, we find bona fide homologues of Apolipoprotein B Editing Complex 1 (APOBEC1) in the genomes of anole lizard and zebra finch, thus implying its appearance prior to the divergence of the amniotes. apolipoprotein B editing complex 1 (APOBEC1), in contrast with other AID/APOBECs acting on DNA, is an RNA-editing enzyme that targets the transcript of Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), thereby causing the translation of a truncated form of the protein. 3'RACE experiments reveal a lizard APOBEC1-like molecule lacking a C-terminal region important for mammalian ApoB RNA editing. This observation pairs with the finding that lizard ApoB is not deaminated at the region corresponding to the mammalian site of editing. Similar to mammalian APOBEC1, the lizard protein is able to deaminate DNA in bacteria and shows a conserved mutational context. Although not precluding the possibility that lizard APOBEC1 acts on unknown mRNA targets, these findings suggest that its ability to target DNA predates its role in RNA editing.},

@article{Kubota:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Cytochrome P450 CYP2 family enzymes are important in a variety of physiological and toxicological processes. CYP2 genes are highly diverse and orthologous relationships remain clouded among CYP2s in different taxa. Sequence and expression analyses of CYP2 genes in diapsids including birds and reptiles may improve understanding of this CYP family. We sought CYP2 genes in a liver cDNA library of the common cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), and in the genomes of other diapsids, chicken (Gallus gallus), zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis), for phylogenetic and/or syntenic analyses. Screening of the cDNA library yielded four CYP2 cDNA clones that were phylogenetically classified as CYP2C45, CYP2J25, CYP2AC1, and CYP2AF1. There are numerous newly identified diapsid CYP2 genes that include genes related to the human CYP2Cs, CYP2D6, CYP2G2P, CYP2J2, CYP2R1, CYP2U1, CYP2W1, CYP2AB1P, and CYP2AC1P. Syntenic relationships show that avian CYP2Hs are orthologous to CYP2C62P in humans, CYP2C23 in rats, and Cyp2c44 in mice, and suggest that avian CYP2Hs, along with human CYP2C62P and mouse Cyp2c44, could be renamed as CYP2C23, based upon the nomenclature rules. Analysis of sequence and synteny identifies cormorant and finch CYPs that are apparent orthologs of phenobarbital-inducible chicken CYP2C45. Transcripts of all four cormorant CYP2 genes were detected in the liver of birds from Lake Biwa, Japan. The transcript levels bore no significant relationship to levels of chlorinated organic pollutants in the liver, including polychlorinated biphenyls and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites. In contrast, concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorononanoic acid were negatively correlated with levels of CYP2C45 and/or CYP2J25, suggesting down-regulation of expression by these environmental pollutants. This study expands our view of the phylogeny and evolution of CYP2s, and provides evolutionary insight into the chemical regulation of CYP2 gene expression in diapsids including birds.},

@article{Novick:2011aa,
	Abstract = {DNA transposons have considerably affected the size and structure of eukaryotic genomes and have been an important source of evolutionary novelties. In vertebrates, DNA transposons are discontinuously distributed due to the frequent extinction and recolonization of these genomes by active elements. We performed a detailed analysis of the DNA transposons in the genome of the lizard Anolis carolinensis, the first non-avian reptile to have its genome sequenced. Elements belonging to six of the previously recognized superfamilies of elements (hAT, Tc1/Mariner, Helitron, PIF/Harbinger, Polinton/Maverick, and Chapaev) were identified. However, only four (hAT, Tc1/Mariner, Helitron, and Chapaev) of these superfamilies have successfully amplified in the anole genome, producing 67 distinct families. The majority (57/67) are nonautonomous and demonstrate an extraordinary diversity of structure, resulting from frequent interelement recombination and incorporation of extraneous DNA sequences. The age distribution of transposon families differs among superfamilies and reveals different dynamics of amplification. Chapaev is the only superfamily to be extinct and is represented only by old copies. The hAT, Tc1/Mariner, and Helitron superfamilies show different pattern of amplification, yet they are predominantly represented by young families, whereas divergent families are exceedingly rare. Although it is likely that some elements, in particular long ones, are subjected to purifying selection and do not reach fixation, the majority of families are neutral and accumulate in the anole genome in large numbers. We propose that the scarcity of old copies in the anole genome results from the rapid decay of elements, caused by a high rate of DNA loss.},

	Abstract = {Neural testosterone metabolism, particularly the synthesis of oestradiol (E(2)) via the aromatase enzyme, is important for sexual behaviours in many vertebrates. In green anole lizards, E(2) metabolised from testosterone facilitates female receptivity and increases sexual motivation in males. Testosterone treatment increases aromatase activity in the whole brain homogenates of gonadectomised male, but not female, anoles, which is an effect limited to the breeding season (BS). To investigate the potential for local effects of this enzyme in reproductive behaviour, we used in situ hybridisation for aromatase mRNA to examine expression during the BS and nonbreeding season (NBS) in areas of the brain that control male sexual behaviours [preoptic area (POA) and amygdala (AMY)], as well as one regulating female reproductive behaviours ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Males had a greater total number of aromatase-expressing cells in the POA than females, and the density of aromatase-expressing cells (number per unit volume) was greater in the VMH and AMY of females. This density was also higher during the BS than NBS in the POA. Expression of aromatase in the AMY appeared to be lateralised because trends were detected for the left side to have more total cells and more cells per unit volume than the right. These results suggest that, similar to other vertebrates, regional aromatisation of testosterone may be important for the control of sex-specific reproductive behaviours.},

	Abstract = {Animals communicating socially are expected to produce signals that are conspicuous within the habitats in which they live. The particular way in which a species adapts to its environment will depend on its ancestral condition and evolutionary history. At this point, it is unclear how properties of the environment and historical factors interact to shape communication. Tropical Anolis lizards advertise territorial ownership using visual displays in habitats where visual motion or "noise" from windblown vegetation poses an acute problem for the detection of display movements. We studied eight Anolis species that live in similar noise environments but belong to separate island radiations with divergent evolutionary histories. We found that species on Puerto Rico displayed at times when their signals were more likely to be detected by neighboring males and females (during periods of low noise). In contrast, species on Jamaica displayed irrespective of the level of environmental motion, apparently because these species have a display that is effective in a range of viewing conditions. Our findings appear to reflect a case of species originating from different evolutionary starting points evolving different signal strategies for effective communication in noisy environments.},

	Abstract = {The 5alpha-reductase (5alphaR) enzyme converts testosterone to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone. This local metabolism within the brain is important for the full expression of male sexual behavior in many species, including green anole lizards. Two isozymes of 5alphaR exist and little is known about their specific distributions. We conducted in situ hybridization for both isozymes in intact male and female green anole brains during the breeding (BS) and non-breeding (NBS) seasons. 5alphaR1 mRNA was only detected in the brainstem, while 5alphaR2 was expressed in specific areas throughout the brain. As our primary interest was evaluating the potential role of 5alphaR in forebrain regulation of reproductive behavior, we quantified 5alphaR2 expression in the preoptic area, amygdala (AMY), and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). More 5alphaR2 cells were detected during the NBS than BS in the AMY, and the density of these cells was greater in females than males. In the VMH, the right side contained more 5alphaR2 cells than the left, an effect driven by a lateralized increase in the NBS. These data expand understanding of the distribution and potential roles of both isozymes in the adult brain, and differences in expression patterns between mammals and birds suggest that they may have been co-opted for different functions later in evolution.},

	Abstract = {Polymorphism often corresponds to alternative mating tactics in males, but much less is known about this relationship in females. However, recent work suggests that selection for alternative reproductive strategies in females can maintain genetic variation in important life-history traits. Brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) exhibit a genetically based polymorphism in dorsal pattern that is expressed only by females, which occur in bar (B), diamond (D) and intermediate diamond-bar (DB) morphs. Here, we use a combination of natural history data, captive breeding studies and phenotypic manipulations of reproductive investment to test the hypothesis that this polymorphism corresponds to morph-specific patterns of reproductive investment. Three years of data from wild females and two generations of captive breeding revealed no differences among morphs in the frequency of egg production or in the number, frequency, size or sex ratio of offspring. Manipulations of reproductive investment via surgical ovariectomy revealed significant costs of reproduction with respect to survival, growth, immune function and haematocrit, but the magnitudes of these costs did not differ among morphs. Collectively, our results refute the hypothesis that this sex-limited polymorphism is maintained by selection for alternative reproductive strategies. We compare this finding to other systems in which polymorphic females exhibit alternative reproductive tactics and discuss other selective factors that could maintain polymorphism in anoles.},

	Abstract = {Subspecies of Anolis lizards are often defined on the basis of geographic variation in the color and pattern of the dewlap, an extensible throat fan considered central to species recognition and sexual selection. Among the most impressive examples of this phenomenon are two species of trunk anoles found across Hispaniola and the Bahamas: Anolis distichus is divided into 16 subspecies with dewlap colors ranging from deep wine red to pale yellow while Anolis brevirostris is divided into three subspecies with dewlaps ranging from pale yellow to orange. Limited sampling of allozyme data indicates some genetic divergence among subspecies and suggests that they may deserve recognition at the species-level. Our goal here is to use more comprehensive geographic sampling of mtDNA haplotypes to test whether the five subspecies of A. distichus and three subspecies of A. brevirostris that occur in the Dominican Republic correspond with genetically distinct populations that may warrant recognition under the general lineage concept. We obtain an aligned dataset of 1462bp comprised of the genes encoding ND2 and adjacent tRNAs from 76 individuals of A. distichus from 28 localities and 12 individuals of A. brevirostris from five localities. We find that haplotypes sampled from each Dominican subspecies of A. distichus form well-supported and deeply divergent clades (>10% uncorrected sequence divergence). Strong concordance between mtDNA haplotype structure and previously diagnosed phenotypic variation in traits central to interspecific communication (i.e., the dewlap) leads us to hypothesize that each of the presently recognized Dominican subspecies of A. distichus and A. brevirostris deserves elevation to full species status under the general lineage concept.},

	Abstract = {Barriers to dispersal and resulting biogeographic boundaries are responsible for much of life's diversity. Distinguishing the contribution of ecological, historical, and stochastic processes to the origin and maintenance of biogeographic boundaries, however, is a longstanding challenge. Taking advantage of newly available data and methods--including environmental niche models and associated comparative metrics--we develop a framework to test two possible ecological explanations for biogeographic boundaries: (1) sharp environmental gradients and (2) ribbons of unsuitable habitat dividing two highly suitable regions. We test each of these hypotheses against the null expectation that environmental variation across a given boundary is no greater than expected by chance. We apply this framework to a pair of Hispaniolan Anolis lizards (A. chlorocyanus and A. coelestinus) distributed on the either side of this island's most important biogeographic boundary. Integrating our results with historical biogeographic analysis, we find that a ribbon of particularly unsuitable habitat is acting to maintain a boundary between species that initially diverged on distinct paleo-islands, which merged to form present-day Hispaniola in the Miocene.},

@article{Stapley:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Color variation across and within populations can play an important role in speciation and our understanding of the maintenance of genetic variation. Trait polymorphisms may be important in reproductive isolation and speciation. Conversely, if 2 morphs exist within a species, then the classical question of how the polymorphism is maintained in the face of drift and selection becomes relevant. In Anolis lizards, variations in dewlap size and color are often used as diagnostic markers of species and considered important traits in population divergence and speciation. The aim of this study was to describe dewlap color pattern variation in Anolis apletophallus and estimate gene flow between populations that have different dewlap color patterns. We confirmed that 2 dewlap morphs exist, a "solid" morph that has an orange dewlap and a "basal" morph that has a white dewlap with an orange basal spot. Throughout most of A. apletophallus' range, the morphs have nonoverlapping distributions, except for one area where both morphs occur in equal frequencies. Analysis of reflectance spectra demonstrated that the color of the dewlap margin differed between morphs but that dewlap color and pattern did not differ across populations within morphs. Using 8 microsatellite markers, we found little genetic differentiation between populations or individuals with different dewlap morphs. In contrast, the small amount of genetic structure that does exist is due to current day geographic barriers. Therefore, dewlap color variation in A. apletophallus appears to be a polymorphism rather than an indicator of 2 fully or partially reproductively isolated populations.},

	Abstract = {Sex-allocation theory predicts that females in good condition should preferentially produce offspring of the sex that benefits the most from an increase in maternal investment. However, it is generally assumed that the condition of the sire has little effect on progeny sex ratio, particularly in species that lack parental care. We used a controlled breeding experiment and molecular paternity analyses to examine the effects of both maternal and paternal condition on progeny sex ratio and progeny fitness in the brown anole (Anolis sagrei), a polygynous lizard that lacks parental care. Contrary to the predictions of sex-allocation theory, we found no relationship between maternal condition and progeny sex ratio. By contrast, progeny sex ratio shifted dramatically from female-biased to male-biased as paternal condition increased. This pattern was driven entirely by an increase in the production of sons as paternal condition improved. Despite strong natural selection favoring large size and high condition in both sons and daughters, we found no evidence that progeny survival was related to paternal condition. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the paternal phenotype in studies of sex allocation and highlight the need for further research into the pathways that link paternal condition to progeny fitness.},

@article{Bergevin:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The tectorial membrane (TM) is widely believed to play an important role in determining the ear's ability to detect and resolve incoming acoustic information. While it is still unclear precisely what that role is, the TM has been hypothesized to help overcome viscous forces and thereby sharpen mechanical tuning of the sensory cells. Lizards present a unique opportunity to further study the role of the TM given the diverse inner-ear morphological differences across species. Furthermore, stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs), sounds emitted by the ear in response to a tone, noninvasively probe the frequency selectivity of the ear. We report estimates of auditory tuning derived from SFOAEs for 12 different species of lizards with widely varying TM morphology. Despite gross anatomical differences across the species examined herein, low-level SFOAEs were readily measurable in all ears tested, even in non-TM species whose basilar papilla contained as few as 50-60 hair cells. Our measurements generally support theoretical predictions: longer delays/sharper tuning features are found in species with a TM relative to those without. However, SFOAEs from at least one non-TM species (Anolis) with long delays suggest there are likely additional micromechanical factors at play that can directly affect tuning. Additionally, in the one species examined with a continuous TM (Aspidoscelis) where cell-to-cell coupling is presumably relatively stronger, delays were intermediate. This observation appears consistent with recent reports that suggest the TM may play a more complex macromechanical role in the mammalian cochlea via longitudinal energy distribution (and thereby affect tuning). Although significant differences exist between reptilian and mammalian auditory biophysics, understanding lizard OAE generation mechanisms yields significant insight into fundamental principles at work in all vertebrate ears.},

	Abstract = {Although lizards have highly sensitive ears, it is difficult to condition them to sound, making standard psychophysical assays of hearing sensitivity impractical. This paper describes non-invasive measurements of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in both Tokay geckos (Gekko gecko; nocturnal animals, known for their loud vocalizations) and the green anole (Anolis carolinensis, diurnal, non-vocal animals). Hearing sensitivity was measured in 5 geckos and 7 anoles. The lizards were sedated with isoflurane, and ABRs were measured at levels of 1 and 3% isoflurane. The typical ABR waveform in response to click stimulation showed one prominent and several smaller peaks occurring within 10 ms of the stimulus onset. ABRs to brief tone bursts revealed that geckos and anoles were most sensitive between 1.6-2 kHz and had similar hearing sensitivity up to about 5 kHz (thresholds typically 20-50 dB SPL). Above 5 kHz, however, anoles were more than 20 dB more sensitive than geckos and showed a wider range of sensitivity (1-7 kHz). Generally, thresholds from ABR audiograms were comparable to those of small birds. Best hearing sensitivity, however, extended over a larger frequency range in lizards than in most bird species.},

	Abstract = {Invasive species can dramatically impact natural populations, especially those living on islands. Though numerous examples illustrate the ecological impact of invasive predators, no study has examined the genetic consequences for native populations subject to invasion. Here we capitalize on a natural experiment in which a long-term study of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) was interrupted by rat invasion. An island population that was devastated by rats recovered numerically following rat extermination. However, population genetic analyses at six microsatellite loci suggested a possible loss of genetic diversity due to invasion when compared to an uninvaded island studied over the same time frame. Our results provide partial support for the hypothesis that invasive predators can impact the genetic diversity of resident island populations.},

@article{Hazard:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Salt glands are used by some vertebrates to excrete hyperosmotic NaCl or KCl solutions in response to dietary salt loads. Control of secretion varies across taxa; some secrete in response to osmotic challenges while others secrete in response to specific dietary ions. We hypothesized that differences in control could be related to different diet-related selective pressures on herbivorous, marine, and insectivorous species. We studied control of secretion and flexibility of cation (sodium or potassium) and anion (chloride or bicarbonate) secretion in two insectivorous lizard species, Schneider's skinks (Eumeces schneideri, Scincidae) and green anoles (Anolis carolinensis, Polychrotidae). Lizards were injected daily for four days with combinations of cations (potassium, sodium, and histidine control) and anions (chloride and acetate control), isoosmotic saline, or sham injection. Secretions were collected daily and analyzed for sodium, potassium, and chloride. Both species secreted only in response to chloride; sodium appeared to have a slight inhibitory effect. Regardless of cation load, skinks secreted a combination of potassium and sodium, while anoles secreted solely potassium. In both species, total cation secretion was matched closely by chloride; very little bicarbonate was secreted. As predicted, secretion in insectivorous lizards was initiated by the dietary ion ecologically most important for these species, chloride, which otherwise cannot be excreted without significant water loss (unlike the cations, which may be excreted as insoluble urate salts). This gives further support to the hypothesis that ecological factors drive the evolution of control mechanisms in lizard salt glands.},

	Abstract = {Anolis lizards communicate with displays consisting of motion of the head and body. Early portions of long-distance displays require movements that are effective at eliciting the attention of potential receivers. We studied signal-motion efficacy using a two-dimensional visual-motion detection (2DMD) model consisting of a grid of correlation-type elementary motion detectors. This 2DMD model has been shown to accurately predict Anolis lizard behavioural response. We tested different patterns of artificially generated motion and found that an abrupt 0.3 degrees shift of position in less than 100 ms is optimal. We quantified motion in displays of 25 individuals from five species. Four species employ near-optimal movement patterns. We tested displays of these species using the 2DMD model on scenes with and without moderate wind. Display movements can easily be detected, even in the presence of windblown vegetation. The fifth species does not typically use the most effective display movements and display movements cannot be discerned by the 2DMD model in the presence of windblown vegetation. A number of Anolis species use abrupt up-and-down head movements approximately 10 mm in amplitude in displays, and these movements appear to be extremely effective for stimulating the receiver visual system.},

Despite decades of study at the chromosomal and single-gene levels, and the evidence for great diversity in genome size, karyotype, and sex chromosome diversity, reptile genomes are virtually unknown in the comparative genomics era. The recent sequencing of the chicken and zebra finch genomes, in conjunction with genome scans and the online publication of the Anolis lizard genome, has begun to clarify the events leading from an ancestral amniote genome--predicted to be large and to possess a diverse repeat landscape on par with mammals and a birdlike sex chromosome system--to the small and highly streamlined genomes of birds. Reptilia exhibit a wide range of evolutionary rates of different subgenomes and, from isochores to mitochondrial DNA, provide a critical contrast to the genomic paradigms established in mammals.},

	Abstract = {The introduction of Anolis cristatellus from the multiple species anole community of Puerto Rico in the Greater Antilles to the island of Dominica in the Lesser Antilles, with its solitary endemic anole, provides an example of a very recent, timed, single colonization. We investigate the geographic origin and adaptive potential of the Dominican population using a range of methods including mtDNA phylogeography, nuclear microsatellite variation and multiple paternity studies, as well as heritability estimates, common garden experiments and comparative geographic studies of quantitative scalation traits. Phylogeographic analysis of NADH2 and microsatellite studies suggests that the Dominican population arose from a set of individuals from the central west area of Puerto Rico within their endemic range. The multiple-individual inoculation, together with sperm storage and evidence of multiple paternity indicate genetic variability and suggest the potential for adaptation by natural selection. Estimates of heritability, common garden experiments and broad sense Q(ST)/F(ST) ratios, linked to replicated comparisons along elevational transects go some way to suggesting that the invasive populations may be adapting by natural selection, in parallel with the endemic anole, in the brief period since their introduction.},

	Abstract = {Ecological opportunity--through entry into a new environment, the origin of a key innovation or extinction of antagonists--is widely thought to link ecological population dynamics to evolutionary diversification. The population-level processes arising from ecological opportunity are well documented under the concept of ecological release. However, there is little consensus as to how these processes promote phenotypic diversification, rapid speciation and adaptive radiation. We propose that ecological opportunity could promote adaptive radiation by generating specific changes to the selective regimes acting on natural populations, both by relaxing effective stabilizing selection and by creating conditions that ultimately generate diversifying selection. We assess theoretical and empirical evidence for these effects of ecological opportunity and review emerging phylogenetic approaches that attempt to detect the signature of ecological opportunity across geological time. Finally, we evaluate the evidence for the evolutionary effects of ecological opportunity in the diversification of Caribbean Anolis lizards. Some of the processes that could link ecological opportunity to adaptive radiation are well documented, but others remain unsupported. We suggest that more study is required to characterize the form of natural selection acting on natural populations and to better describe the relationship between ecological opportunity and speciation rates.},

@article{Spiller:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The effect of resource subsidies on recipient food webs has received much recent attention. The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of significant seasonal seaweed deposition events, caused by hurricanes and other storms, on species inhabiting subtropical islands. The seaweed represents a pulsed resource subsidy that is consumed by amphipods and flies, which are eaten by lizards and predatory arthropods, which in turn consume terrestrial herbivores. Additionally, seaweed decomposes directly into the soil under plants. We added seaweed to six shoreline plots and removed seaweed from six other plots for three months; all plots were repeatedly monitored for 12 months after the initial manipulation. Lizard density (Anolis sagrei) responded rapidly, and the overall average was 63% higher in subsidized than in removal plots. Stable-isotope analysis revealed a shift in lizard diet composition toward more marine-based prey in subsidized plots. Leaf damage was 70% higher in subsidized than in removal plots after eight months, but subsequent damage was about the same in the two treatments. Foliage growth rate was 70% higher in subsidized plots after 12 months. Results of a complementary study on the relationship between natural variation in marine subsidies and island food web components were consistent with the experimental results. We suggest two causal pathways for the effects of marine subsidies on terrestrial plants: (1) the "fertilization effect" in which seaweed adds nutrients to plants, increasing their growth rate, and (2) the "predator diet shift effect" in which lizards shift from eating local prey (including terrestrial herbivores) to eating mostly marine detritivores.},

	Abstract = {The pace of phenotypic diversification during adaptive radiation should decrease as ecological opportunity declines. We test this prediction using phylogenetic comparative analyses of a wide range of morphological traits in Greater Antillean Anolis lizards. We find that the rate of diversification along two important axes of Anolis radiation-body size and limb dimensions-decreased as opportunity declined, with opportunity quantified either as time elapsed in the radiation or as the diversity of competing anole lineages inferred to have been present on an island at different times in the past. Most previous studies of the ecological opportunity hypothesis have focused on the rate of species diversification; our results provide a complementary perspective, indicating that the rate of phenotypic diversification declines with decreasing opportunity in an adaptive radiation.},

@article{Calsbeek:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Field experiments that measure natural selection in response to manipulations of the selective regime are extremely rare, even in systems where the ecological basis of adaptation has been studied extensively. The adaptive radiation of Caribbean Anolis lizards has been studied for decades, leading to precise predictions about the influence of alternative agents of selection in the wild. Here we present experimental evidence for the relative importance of two putative agents of selection in shaping the adaptive landscape for a classic island radiation. We manipulated whole-island populations of the brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei, to measure the relative importance of predation versus competition as agents of natural selection. We excluded or included bird and snake predators across six islands that ranged from low to high population densities of lizards, then measured subsequent differences in behaviour and natural selection in each population. Predators altered the lizards' perching behaviour and increased mortality, but predation treatments did not alter selection on phenotypic traits. By contrast, experimentally increasing population density dramatically increased the strength of viability selection favouring large body size, long relative limb length and high running stamina. Our results from A. sagrei are consistent with the hypothesis that intraspecific competition is more important than predation in shaping the selective landscape for traits central to the adaptive radiation of Anolis ecomorphs.},

@article{Huang:2010aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which can be identified based on a unique helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain (DBD) are a large family of transcription factors involved in host immune response, haemotopoietic differentiation and immunomodulation. Despite the identification of ten IRF family members in mammals, and some recent effort to identify these members in fish, relatively little is known in the composition of these members in other classes of vertebrates, and the evolution and probably the origin of the IRF family have not been investigated in vertebrates. RESULTS: Genome data mining has been performed to identify any possible IRF family members in human, mouse, dog, chicken, anole lizard, frog, and some teleost fish, mainly zebrafish and stickleback, and also in non-vertebrate deuterostomes including the hemichordate, cephalochordate, urochordate and echinoderm. In vertebrates, all ten IRF family members, i.e. IRF-1 to IRF-10 were identified, with two genes of IRF-4 and IRF-6 identified in fish and frog, respectively, except that in zebrafish exist three IRF-4 genes. Surprisingly, an additional member in the IRF family, IRF-11 was found in teleost fish. A range of two to ten IRF-like genes were detected in the non-vertebrate deuterostomes, and they had little similarity to those IRF family members in vertebrates as revealed in genomic structure and in phylogenetic analysis. However, the ten IRF family members, IRF-1 to IRF-10 showed certain degrees of conservation in terms of genomic structure and gene synteny. In particular, IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-6, IRF-8 are quite conserved in their genomic structure in all vertebrates, and to a less degree, some IRF family members, such as IRF-5 and IRF-9 are comparable in the structure. Synteny analysis revealed that the gene loci for the ten IRF family members in vertebrates were also quite conservative, but in zebrafish conserved genes were distributed in a much longer distance in chromosomes. Furthermore, all ten different members are clustered in respectively different clades; but the IRF-11 was clustered with one in sea urchin. CONCLUSIONS: In vertebrates, the ten well-characterized IRF family members shared a relatively high degree of similarity in genomic structure and syntenic gene arrangement, implying that they might have been evolved in a similar pattern and with similar selective pressure in different classes of vertebrates. Genome and/or gene duplication, and probably gene shuffling or gene loss might have occurred during the evolution of these IRF family members, but arrangement of chromosome or its segment might have taken place in zebrafish. However, the ten IRF family members in vertebrates and those IRF-like genes in non-vertebrate deuterostomes were quite different in those analyzed characters, as they might have undergone different patterns of evolution.},

@article{Thorpe:2010aa,
	Abstract = {From Darwin's study of the Galapagos and Wallace's study of Indonesia, islands have played an important role in evolutionary investigations, and radiations within archipelagos are readily interpreted as supporting the conventional view of allopatric speciation. Even during the ongoing paradigm shift towards other modes of speciation, island radiations, such as the Lesser Antillean anoles, are thought to exemplify this process. Geological and molecular phylogenetic evidence show that, in this archipelago, Martinique anoles provide several examples of secondary contact of island species. Four precursor island species, with up to 8 mybp divergence, met when their islands coalesced to form the current island of Martinique. Moreover, adjacent anole populations also show marked adaptation to distinct habitat zonation, allowing both allopatric and ecological speciation to be tested in this system. We take advantage of this opportunity of replicated island coalescence and independent ecological adaptation to carry out an extensive population genetic study of hypervariable neutral nuclear markers to show that even after these very substantial periods of spatial isolation these putative allospecies show less reproductive isolation than conspecific populations in adjacent habitats in all three cases of subsequent island coalescence. The degree of genetic interchange shows that while there is always a significant genetic signature of past allopatry, and this may be quite strong if the selection regime allows, there is no case of complete allopatric speciation, in spite of the strong primae facie case for it. Importantly there is greater genetic isolation across the xeric/rainforest ecotone than is associated with any secondary contact. This rejects the development of reproductive isolation in allopatric divergence, but supports the potential for ecological speciation, even though full speciation has not been achieved in this case. It also explains the paucity of anole species in the Lesser Antilles compared to the Greater Antilles.},

	Abstract = {Two factors that can lead to geographic structuring in conspecific populations are barriers to dispersal and climatic stability. Populations that occur in different physiographic regions may be restricted to those areas by physical and/or ecological barriers, which may facilitate the formation of phylogeographic clades. Long-term climatic stability can also promote genetic diversification, because new clades are more likely to evolve in areas that experience lesser climatic shifts. We conducted a phylogeographic study of the Puerto Rican lizard Anolis krugi to assess whether populations of this anole show genetic discontinuities across the species' range, and if they do, whether these breaks coincide with the boundaries of the five physiographic regions of Puerto Rico. We also assessed whether interpopulation genetic distances in A. krugi are positively correlated with relative climatic stability in the island. Anolis krugi exhibits genetic structuring, but the phylogroups do not correspond to the physiographic regions of Puerto Rico. We used climatic reconstructions of two environmental extremes of the Quaternary period, the present conditions and those during the last glacial maximum (LGM), to quantify the degree of climatic stability between sampling locations. We documented positive correlations between genetic distances and relative climatic stability, although these associations were not significant when corrected for autocorrelation. Principal component analyses indicated the existence of climatic niche differences between some phylogeographic clades of A. krugi. The approach that we employed to assess the relationship between climatic stability and the genetic architecture of A. krugi can also be used to investigate the impact of factors such as the spatial distribution of food sources, parasites, predators or competitors on the genetic landscape of a species.},

	Abstract = {Studies often examine egg yolks after oviposition with the goal of drawing conclusions about maternal allocation of gonadal steroid hormones and how it may affect offspring development. However, these hormones might originate from a few sources, including the ovary, blood plasma, or the embryo itself. The goal of this study was to investigate whether maternal steroids can enter oviductal eggs. In Experiment 1, gravid female green anole lizards were injected with 1 microCi 3H-T. Plasma, ovarian follicles (separated into yolking and non-yolking samples), and shelled oviductal eggs were collected at times ranging from 15 min to 24 hr after treatment. Main effects of tissue, time, and an interaction between them all existed on recovered 3H-hormone corrected for tissue mass. Of particular interest, there was a decrease in plasma with coincident increase in eggs. In Experiment 2, females were injected with doses ranging from 0.01 to 0.45 microCi of 3H-T per gram body weight. Across tissues, 3H-hormone levels corrected for mass were greater with increasing doses. Values also differed among tissues and an interaction was detected. Within each dose, plasma and non-yolking follicles generally had higher concentrations of 3H-hormone than did yolking follicles and oviductal eggs. However, at and after 6 hr, eggs had higher total radioactivity levels than both yolking and non-yolking follicles had (not corrected for mass). The results indicate that steroids can cross through relatively well-formed shells before oviposition, suggesting a way in which maternal hormones might influence developmental factors after yolk deposition.},

	Abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) have profound effects on the structure, function and evolution of their host genomes. Our knowledge about these agents of genomic change in sauropsids, a sister group of mammals that includes all extant reptiles and birds, is still very limited. Invaluable information concerning the diversity, activity and repetitive landscapes in sauropsids has recently emerged from analyses of the draft genomes of chicken and Anolis and other preliminary reptilian genome sequencing projects. Avian and reptilian genomes differ significantly in the classes of TEs present, their fractional representation in the genome and by the level of TE activity. While lepidosaurian genomes contain many young, active TE families, the extant avian genomes have very few active TE lineages. Most reptilian genomes possess quite rich TE repertoires that differ considerably from those of birds and mammals, being more similar in diversity to that of lower vertebrates. The large amount of recently accumulated genome-wide data on TEs in diverse lineages of sauropsids has provided a remarkable opportunity to review current knowledge about TEs of sauropsids in their genomic context.},

	Abstract = {When selection favors sexual dimorphism, high-fitness parents often produce low-fitness progeny of the opposite sex. This sexual conflict is thought to overwhelm the genetic benefits of mate choice because preferred males incur a cost through the production of low-fitness daughters. We provide a counterpoint in a lizard (Anolis sagrei) that exhibits sexual conflict over body size. By using mate-choice experiments, we show that female brown anoles produce more sons than daughters via large sires but more daughters than sons via small sires. Measures of progeny fitness in the wild suggest that maximal fitness payoffs can be achieved by shifting offspring production from daughters to sons as sire size increases. These results illustrate how the resolution of sexual conflict can restore the genetic benefits of mate choice.},

	Abstract = {Individual social status discriminates rapid neuroendocrine responses to non-social stress in male Anolis carolinensis, but whether such status-influenced reactions are retained in response to subsequent social stress is unknown. Dominant and subordinate males modify their behavioral responses to social challenge according to familiarity of the opponent, suggesting that accompanying neuroendocrine responses may differ according to opponent recognition despite social rank. We examined endocrine and neurochemical correlates of prior social status and opponent recognition during the opening stages of social challenge. Male pairs interacted and established dominant/subordinate status, followed by 3 days separation. Subsequently, subjects were paired with either the same opponent or an unfamiliar male according to rank (dominant with subordinate). After 90 s of social exposure, subjects were caught and brains and plasma collected for measurement of circulating corticosterone and limbic monoamines. Controls included pairs experiencing just one 90 s encounter plus a group of non-interacting subjects. Opponent recognition differentiated status-influenced responses, such that dominant lizards paired with familiar subordinate opponents had increased hippocampal dopamine and epinephrine, but showed increased plasma corticosterone and ventral tegmental area (VTA) norepinephrine when challenged with an unfamiliar opponent. Subordinate lizards encountering familiar opponents also had increased corticosterone, along with decreased hippocampal dopamine and increased VTA epinephrine, but showed no changes in response to an unfamiliar opponent. Such plasticity in status-influenced rapid neuroendocrine responses according to opponent recognition may be necessary for facilitating production of behavioral responses adaptive for particular social contexts, such as encountering a novel versus familiar opponent.},

	Abstract = {Relationships between structure and function are a primary focus in biology, yet they are most often considered within individual species. Sexually dimorphic communication behaviours and the morphology of associated structures can vary widely, even among closely related species, and these traits provide an ideal opportunity to investigate the evolution of structure-function patterns. Using nine Anolis lizard species, we addressed a series of questions regarding sex differences in and the evolution of relationships between extension of the throat fan (dewlap) and morphology of the muscles and cartilage controlling it. The main results indicated that within species, males displayed the dewlap more often than females and consistently exhibited larger associated structures. These data are consistent with work in other vertebrates in which corresponding sex differences in reproductive morphology and behaviour have been documented. Across species, however, we found no evidence that the rate of dewlap extension evolved in association with dewlap morphology. Thus, we provide an example of traits that, when considered in a phylogenetic framework, exhibited limited associations between behaviour and morphology, perhaps as the result of constraints imposed by the ecological contexts in which different species occur.},

	Abstract = {We conducted an experiment on female Anolis carolinensis lizards to investigate whether social factors influenced their selection of an end-chamber in a test arena. We tested (1) whether characteristics of males previously seen in the end-chambers would influence female choice and (2) whether the presence of other females simultaneously choosing would influence choice. In experiment one, females observed a large and a small male in the end-chambers prior to choosing. Females were tested individually and in pairs. When tested individually, females preferred the end-chamber previously inhabited by the larger male. When females were tested in pairs, however, in each case one female chose the large male's end-chamber and the other female failed to make a choice. In experiment two, we conducted the same paired-choice test, but prior to the test we evaluated the dominance relationships between the pair of females. In the majority of cases, the more dominant female was the one to enter the large male's end-chamber. Results indicate that females are influenced by the presence and characteristics of males, but that female competition also plays a role in choice.},

@article{Craxton:2010aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Synaptotagmin proteins were first identified in nervous tissue, residing in synaptic vesicles. Synaptotagmins were subsequently found to form a large family, some members of which play important roles in calcium triggered exocytic events. These members have been investigated intensively, but other family members are not well understood, making it difficult to grasp the meaning of family membership in functional terms. Further difficulty arises as families are defined quite legitimately in different ways: by common descent or by common possession of distinguishing features. One definition does not necessarily imply the other. The evolutionary range of genome sequences now available, can shed more light on synaptotagmin gene phylogeny and clarify family relationships. The aim of compiling this open access collection of synaptotagmin and synaptotagmin-like sequences, is that its use may lead to greater understanding of the biological function of these proteins in an evolutionary context. RESULTS: 46 metazoan genomes were examined and their complement of Syt, Esyt, Rph3a, Rph3al, Doc2 and Dblc2 genes identified. All of the sequences were compared, named, then examined in detail. Esyt genes were formerly named Fam62. The species in this collection are Trichoplax, Nematostella, Capitella, Helobdella, Lottia, Ciona, Strongylocentrotus, Branchiostoma, Ixodes, Daphnia, Acyrthosiphon, Tribolium, Nasonia, Apis, Anopheles, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, Takifugu, Tetraodon, Gasterosteus, Oryzias, Danio, Xenopus, Anolis, Gallus, Taeniopygia,Ornithorhynchus, Monodelphis, Mus and Homo. All of the data described in this paper is available as additional files. CONCLUSIONS: Only a subset of synaptotagmin proteins appear able to function as calcium triggers. Syt1, Syt7 and Syt9 are ancient conserved synaptotagmins of this type. Some animals carry extensive repertoires of synaptotagmin genes. Other animals of no less complexity, carry only a small repertoire. Current understanding does not explain why this is so. The biological roles of many synaptotagmins remain to be understood. This collection of genes offers prospects for fruitful speculation about the functional roles of the synaptotagmin repertoires of different animals and includes a great range of biological complexity. With reference to this gene collection, functional relationships among Syt, Esyt, Rph3a, Rph3al, Doc2 and Dblc2 genes, which encode similar proteins, can better be assessed in future.},

	Abstract = {Intra-specific body size variation is common and often is assumed to be adaptive. Studies of body size variation among sites should include or consider environmental and ecological variables in their designs. Additionally, reciprocal transplant or common garden studies will support which variables are really contributing to the observed body size variation. This study analyzed the microgeographic body size variation in Anolis mariarum, a small lizard endemic to Antioquia, Colombia. Parameters such as body size, shape, and lepidosis variation were quantified in 217 adult A. mariarum, belonging to six populations separated by less than 80km. Results showed that significant body size variation was not related to differences among sites in mean annual temperature, but covaried with mean annual precipitation, with the largest individuals occurring in dryer sites. Mark-recapture data obtained from 115 individuals from both the wettest and dryest sites from October 2004 to April 2005 showed that growth rates were higher at the latter. Eight males from each site were captured at the end of the mark-recapture study and reared for two months under identical conditions in a common garden study. Individuals from both sites grew faster when reared in the laboratory with food provided ad libitum. Although growth rates of males from the two populations did not differ significantly in the laboratory, males from the dryest site still maintained a significantly larger asymptotic body size in their growth trajectories. Multivariate analyses also demonstrated that both males and females from the six populations differed in terms of body shape and lepidosis. However, only female body size was found to covary significantly with an environmental gradient (precipitation). A. mariarum does not conform to Bergmann's rule, but the relationship found between mean body size and asympotic growth with mean annual precipitation at these sites needs further analysis. Generally, studies of intra-specific body size variation should consider a number of additional phenotypic traits to provide stronger baseline information on the degree of overall divergence among populations, including those likely to be selectively neutral, before interpreting results of analyses on the body size differences.},

	Abstract = {The reptiles are the last major taxon of jawed vertebrates in which immunoglobulin light chain isotypes have not been well characterized. Using the recently released genome sequencing data, we show in this study that the reptile Anolis carolinensis expresses both lambda and kappa light chain genes. The genomic organization of both gene loci is structurally similar to their respective counterparts in mammals. The identified lambda locus contains three constant region genes each preceded by a joining gene segment, and a total of 37 variable gene segments. In contrast, the kappa locus contains only a single constant region gene, and two joining gene segments with a single family of 14 variable gene segments located upstream. Analysis of junctions of the recombined VJ transcripts reveals a paucity of N and P nucleotides in both expressed lambda and kappa sequences. These results help us to understand the generation of the immunoglobulin repertoire in reptiles and immunoglobulin evolution in vertebrates.},

@article{Hoffmann:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The alpha- and beta-globin gene families of jawed vertebrates have diversified with respect to both gene function and the developmental timing of gene expression. Phylogenetic reconstructions of globin gene family evolution have provided suggestive evidence that the developmental regulation of hemoglobin synthesis has evolved independently in multiple vertebrate lineages. For example, the embryonic beta-like globin genes of birds and placental mammals are not 1:1 orthologs. Despite the similarity in developmental expression profiles, the genes are independently derived from lineage-specific duplications of a beta-globin pro-ortholog. This suggests the possibility that other vertebrate taxa may also possess distinct repertoires of globin genes that were produced by repeated rounds of lineage-specific gene duplication and divergence. Until recently, investigations into this possibility have been hindered by the dearth of genomic sequence data from nonmammalian vertebrates. Here, we report new insights into globin gene family evolution that were provided by a phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate globins combined with a comparative genomic analysis of three key sauropsid taxa: a squamate reptile (anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis), a passeriform bird (zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata), and a galliform bird (chicken, Gallus gallus). The main objectives of this study were 1) to characterize evolutionary changes in the size and membership composition of the alpha- and beta-globin gene families of tetrapod vertebrates and 2) to test whether functional diversification of the globin gene clusters occurred independently in different tetrapod lineages. Results of our comparative genomic analysis revealed several intriguing patterns of gene turnover in the globin gene clusters of different taxa. Lineage-specific differences in gene content were especially pronounced in the beta-globin gene family, as phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that amphibians, lepidosaurs (as represented by anole lizard), archosaurs (as represented by zebra finch and chicken), and mammals each possess a distinct independently derived repertoire of beta-like globin genes. In contrast to the ancient functional diversification of the alpha-globin gene cluster in the stem lineage of tetrapods, the physiological division of labor between early- and late-expressed genes in the beta-globin gene cluster appears to have evolved independently in several tetrapod lineages.},

However, G itself also evolves in response to selection. In particular, we expect that, over time, G will evolve correspondence with the pattern of multivariate nonlinear natural selection. In this study, we substitute the phenotypic variance-covariance matrix (P) for G to determine if the pattern of multivariate nonlinear selection in a natural population of Anolis cristatellus, an arboreal lizard from Puerto Rico, has influenced the evolution of genetic variances and covariances in this species. Although results varied among our estimates of P and fitness, and among our analytic techniques, we find significant evidence for congruence between nonlinear selection and P, suggesting that natural selection may have influenced the evolution of genetic constraint in this species.},

@article{Cox:2010ab,
	Abstract = {A central tenet of life-history theory is that investment in reproduction compromises survival. We tested for costs of reproduction in wild brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) by eliminating reproductive investment via surgical ovariectomy and/or removal of oviductal eggs. Anoles are unusual among lizards in that females lay single-egg clutches at frequent intervals throughout a lengthy reproductive season. This evolutionary reduction in clutch size is thought to decrease the physical burden of reproduction, but our results show that even a single egg significantly impairs stamina and sprint speed. Reproductive females also suffered a reduction in growth, suggesting that the cumulative energetic cost of successive clutches constrains the allocation of energy to other important functions. Finally, in each of two separate years, elimination of reproductive investment increased breeding-season survival by 56%, overwinter survival by 96%, and interannual survival by 200% relative to reproductive controls. This extreme fitness cost of reproduction may reflect a combination of intrinsic (i.e., reduced allocation of energy to maintenance) and extrinsic (i.e., increased susceptibility to predators) sources of mortality. Our results provide clear experimental support for a central tenet of life-history theory and show that costs of reproduction persist in anoles despite the evolution of a single-egg clutch.},

@article{Cohen:2010ac,
	Abstract = {Testosterone (T) and its metabolites are important in the regulation of reproductive behavior in males of a variety of vertebrate species. Aromatase converts T to estradiol and 5alpha-reductase converts T to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Male green anole reproduction depends on androgens, yet 5alpha-reductase in the brain is not sexually dimorphic and does not vary with season. In contrast, aromatase activity in the male brain is increased during the breeding compared to non-breeding season, and males have higher levels than females during the breeding season. Aromatase is important for female, but not male, sexual behaviors. The present experiment was conducted to determine whether 5alpha-reductase and aromatase are regulated by T. Enzyme activity was quantified in whole brain homogenates in both the breeding and non-breeding seasons in males and females that had been treated with either a T or blank implant. In males only, T increased 5alpha-reductase activity regardless of season and up-regulated aromatase during the breeding season specifically. Thus, regulation of both enzymes occurs in males, whereas females do not show parallel sensitivity to T. When considered with previous results, the data suggest that aromatase might influence a male function associated with the breeding season other than sexual behavior. 5alpha-Reductase can be mediated by T availability, but this regulation may not serve a sex- or season-specific purpose.},

	Abstract = {Motion in the visual periphery of lizards, and other animals, often causes a shift of visual attention toward the moving object. This behavioral response must be more responsive to relevant motion (predators, prey, conspecifics) than to irrelevant motion (windblown vegetation). Early stages of visual motion detection rely on simple local circuits known as elementary motion detectors (EMDs). We presented a computer model consisting of a grid of correlation-type EMDs, with videos of natural motion patterns, including prey, predators and windblown vegetation. We systematically varied the model parameters and quantified the relative response to the different classes of motion. We carried out behavioral experiments with the lizard Anolis sagrei and determined that their visual response could be modeled with a grid of correlation-type EMDs with a spacing parameter of 0.3 degrees visual angle, and a time constant of 0.1 s. The model with these parameters gave substantially stronger responses to relevant motion patterns than to windblown vegetation under equivalent conditions. However, the model is sensitive to local contrast and viewer-object distance. Therefore, additional neural processing is probably required for the visual system to reliably distinguish relevant from irrelevant motion under a full range of natural conditions.},

@article{Jiang:2009aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The vertebrate protocadherins are a subfamily of cell adhesion molecules that are predominantly expressed in the nervous system and are believed to play an important role in establishing the complex neural network during animal development. Genes encoding these molecules are organized into a cluster in the genome. Comparative analysis of the protocadherin subcluster organization and gene arrangements in different vertebrates has provided interesting insights into the history of vertebrate genome evolution. Among tetrapods, protocadherin clusters have been fully characterized only in mammals. In this study, we report the identification and comparative analysis of the protocadherin cluster in a reptile, the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that the anole protocadherin cluster spans over a megabase and encodes a total of 71 genes. The number of genes in the anole protocadherin cluster is significantly higher than that in the coelacanth (49 genes) and mammalian (54-59 genes) clusters. The anole protocadherin genes are organized into four subclusters: the delta, alpha, beta and gamma. This subcluster organization is identical to that of the coelacanth protocadherin cluster, but differs from the mammalian clusters which lack the delta subcluster. The gene number expansion in the anole protocadherin cluster is largely due to the extensive gene duplication in the gammab subgroup. Similar to coelacanth and elephant shark protocadherin genes, the anole protocadherin genes have experienced a low frequency of gene conversion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that similar to the protocadherin clusters in other vertebrates, the evolution of anole protocadherin cluster is driven mainly by lineage-specific gene duplications and degeneration. Our analysis also shows that loss of the protocadherin delta subcluster in the mammalian lineage occurred after the divergence of mammals and reptiles. We present a model for the evolutionary history of the protocadherin cluster in tetrapods.},

	Abstract = {Most studies of adaptive radiations focus on morphological aspects of differentiation, yet behavior is also an important component of evolutionary diversification, often mediating the relationship between animal ecology and morphology. In species within radiations that are convergent in ecology and morphology, we then also expect convergence in behavior. Here, we examined 13 Anolis lizard species to determine whether territorial strategies have evolved convergently with morphology and habitat use. We evaluated two aspects of territoriality: behavioral defense of space via territorial displays, and territory overlap within and between sexes. Controlling for the phylogenetic relationships of the taxa in our study, we found that species similar in perch height and diameter convergently evolved patterns of territory overlap, whereas species similar in habitat visibility (the proportion of space that can be seen from a perch) convergently evolved display behavior. We also found that species with greater display time have more extensive male-male territory overlap. This study provides strong evidence for the role of habitat in the evolution of territoriality and suggests that the social structure of a species ultimately evolves in concert with habitat use and morphology.},

	Abstract = {Steroid hormones activate sexual behaviors across vertebrate species. In green anole lizards, testosterone is particularly important for the display of courtship and copulation by adult males. However, unlike a variety of other species, the role of its metabolite, estradiol, has been unclear. To evaluate its function and potential interaction with testosterone in the facilitation of reproductive behaviors, adult males were gonadectomized and given two treatments. The first consisted of either estradiol or its vehicle, and the second testosterone or a blank control. Parallel manipulations were done in the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Courtship and copulatory behaviors were more readily facilitated during the breeding than non-breeding season. As predicted based on previous experiments, testosterone increased the display of sexual behaviors. In addition, estradiol increased mount attempts. While this hormone did not influence the effects of subsequent testosterone exposure, the present data are consistent with the idea that it facilitates a component of reproduction in the green anole, as in species from other taxa.},

@article{Weldon:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The Puerto Rican Racer Alsophis portoricensis is known to use venom to subdue lizard prey, and extensive damage to specific lizard body tissues has been well documented. The toxicity and biochemistry of the venom, however, has not been explored extensively. We employed biological assays and proteomic techniques to characterize venom from A. portoricensis anegadae collected from Guana Island, British Virgin Islands. High metalloproteinase and gelatinase, as well as low acetylcholinesterase and phosphodiesterase activities were detected, and the venom hydrolyzed the alpha-subunit of human fibrinogen very rapidly. SDS-PAGE analysis of venoms revealed up to 22 protein bands, with masses of approximately 5-160 kDa; very little variation among individual snakes or within one snake between venom extractions was observed. Most bands were approximately 25-62 kD, but MALDI-TOF analysis of crude venom indicated considerable complexity in the 1.5-13 kD mass range, including low intensity peaks in the 6.2-8.8 kD mass range (potential three-finger toxins). MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis of tryptic peptides confirmed that a 25 kDa band was a venom cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRiSP) with sequence homology with tigrin, a CRiSP from the natricine colubrid Rhabdophis tigrinus. The venom was quite toxic to NSA mice (Mus musculus: LD(50)=2.1 microg/g), as well as to Anolis lizards (A. carolinensis: 3.8 microg/g). Histology of the venom gland showed distinctive differences from the supralabial salivary glands (serous vs. mucosecretory), and like the Brown Treesnake (Boiga irregularis), another rear-fanged snake, serous secretory cells are arranged in densely packed secretory tubules, with little venom present in tubule lumina. These results clearly demonstrate that venom from A. portoricensis shares components with venoms of front-fanged snakes as well as with other rear-fanged species. Venom from A. portoricensis, in particular the prominent metalloproteinase activity, likely serves an important trophic function by facilitating prey handling and predigestion of prey.},

	Abstract = {Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is thought to evolve due to sex differences in selection on body size, but it is largely unknown whether intraspecific variation in SSD reflects differences in sex-specific selection among populations. We addressed this question by comparing viability selection between two island populations of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) that differ in the magnitude of male-biased SSD. On both islands, females experienced stabilizing selection favoring intermediate size whereas males experienced directional selection favoring larger size. Thus, sex-specific selection matched the overall pattern of male-biased SSD, but population differences in the magnitude of SSD were not associated with local differences in selection. Rather, population differences in SSD appear to result from underlying differences in the environmental potential for a rapid growth, coupled with sex-specific phenotypic plasticity. Males grew more slowly on the island with low SSD whereas growth of females did not differ between islands. Both sexes had substantially lower mass per unit length on the island with low SSD, suggesting that they were in a relatively poorer energetic condition. We propose that this energetic constraint disproportionately impacts growth of males due to their greater absolute energy requirements, thus driving intraspecific variation in SSD.},

@article{Alibardi:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Adhesive devices of digital pads of gecko lizards are formed by microscopic hair-like structures termed setae that derive from the interaction between the oberhautchen and the clear layer of the epidermis. The two layers form the shedding complex and permit skin shedding in lizards. Setae consist of a resistant but flexible corneous material largely made of keratin-associated beta-proteins (KA beta Ps, formerly called beta-keratins) of 8-22 kDa and of alpha-keratins of 45-60 kDa. In Gekko gecko, 19 sauropsid keratin-associated beta-proteins (sKAbetaPs) and at least two larger alpha-keratins are expressed in the setae. Some sKA beta Ps are rich in cysteine (111-114 amino acids), while others are rich in glycine (169-219 amino acids). In the entire genome of Anolis carolinensis 40 Ka beta Ps are present and participate in the formation of all types of scales, pad lamellae and claws. Nineteen sKA beta Ps comprise cysteine-rich 9.2-14.4 kDa proteins of 89-142 amino acids, and 19 are glycine-rich 16.5-22.0 kDa proteins containing 162-225 amino acids, and only two types of sKA beta Ps are cysteine- and glycine-poor proteins. Genes coding for these proteins contain an intron in the 5'-non-coding region, a typical characteristic of most sauropsid Ka beta Ps. Gecko KA beta Ps show a central amino acid region of high homology and a beta-pleated conformation that is likely responsible for the polymerization of Ka beta Ps into long and resistant filaments. The association of numerous filaments, probably over a framework of alpha-keratins, permits the formation of bundles of corneous material for the elongation of setae, which may be over 100 microm long. The terminals branching off each seta may derive from the organization of the cytoskeleton and from the mechanical separation of keratin bundles located at the terminal apex of setae.},

@article{Steiger:2009aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The detection of odorants is mediated by olfactory receptors (ORs). ORs are G-protein coupled receptors that form a remarkably large protein superfamily in vertebrate genomes. We used data that became available through recent sequencing efforts of reptilian and avian genomes to identify the complete OR gene repertoires in a lizard, the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), and in two birds, the chicken (Gallus gallus) and the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). RESULTS: We identified 156 green anole OR genes, including 42 pseudogenes. The OR gene repertoire of the two bird species was substantially larger with 479 and 553 OR gene homologs in the chicken and zebra finch, respectively (including 111 and 221 pseudogenes, respectively). We show that the green anole has a higher fraction of intact OR genes (approximately 72%) compared with the chicken (approximately 66%) and the zebra finch (approximately 38%). We identified a larger number and a substantially higher proportion of intact OR gene homologs in the chicken genome than previously reported (214 versus 82 genes and 66% versus 15%, respectively). Phylogenetic analysis showed that lizard and bird OR gene repertoires consist of group alpha, theta and gamma genes. Interestingly, the vast majority of the avian OR genes are confined to a large expansion of a single branch (the so called gamma-c clade). An analysis of the selective pressure on the paralogous genes of each gamma-c clade revealed that they have been subjected to adaptive evolution. This expansion appears to be bird-specific and not sauropsid-specific, as it is lacking from the lizard genome. The gamma-c expansions of the two birds do not intermix, i.e., they are lineage-specific. Almost all (group gamma-c) OR genes mapped to the unknown chromosome. The remaining OR genes mapped to six homologous chromosomes plus three to four additional chromosomes in the zebra finch and chicken. CONCLUSION: We identified a surprisingly large number of potentially functional avian OR genes. Our data supports recent evidence that avian olfactory ability may be better developed than previously thought. We hypothesize that the radiation of the group gamma-c OR genes in each bird lineage parallels the evolution of specific olfactory sensory functions.},

	Abstract = {Closely related species often have signals that differ dramatically in design. The evolution of such differences may be important in the process of speciation. Selection for signal detectability under different habitat conditions has been proposed as a mechanism leading to the evolution of signal diversity. We examined dewlap color in four closely related species of Anolis lizards that occupy habitats with different light conditions. Initially, we tested the hypothesis that lizards choose specific light conditions within each habitat in which to signal. We rejected this hypothesis for all four species. We next calculated the detectability of the dewlap color of all four species at display locations in each habitat. If selection for detectability under the different light conditions explained the divergence in signal design, the occupant of a given habitat was predicted to have the highest signal detectability in that habitat. However, the rank order of detectability of the four dewlap colors was nearly the same in all four habitats. We concluded that divergent selection for signal detectability does not, by itself, explain the evolution of dewlap color diversity. We hypothesize that the evolution of dewlap color diversity results from simultaneous selection for multiple functions of dewlap color.},

@article{Novick:2010aa,
	Abstract = {In animals, the mode of transmission of transposable elements is generally vertical. However, recent studies have suggested that lateral transfer has occurred repeatedly in several distantly related tetrapod lineages, including mammals. Using transposons extracted from the genome of the lizard Anolis carolinensis as probes, we identified four novel families of hAT transposons that share extremely high similarity with elements in other genomes including several mammalian lineages (primates, chiropters, marsupials), one amphibian and one flatworm, the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. The discontinuous phylogenetic distribution of these hAT families, coupled with very low synonymous divergence between species, strongly suggests that these elements were laterally transferred to these different species. This indicates that the horizontal transfer of DNA transposons in vertebrates might be more common than previously thought. Yet, it appears that the transfer of DNA transposons did not occur randomly as the same genomes have been invaded independently by different, unrelated transposon families whereas others seem to be immune to lateral transfer. This suggests that some organisms might be intrinsically more vulnerable to DNA transposon lateral transfer, possibly because of a weakened defense against transposons or because they have developed mechanisms to tolerate their impact.},

@article{Koshiba-Takeuchi:2009aa,
	Abstract = {The emergence of terrestrial life witnessed the need for more sophisticated circulatory systems. This has evolved in birds, mammals and crocodilians into complete septation of the heart into left and right sides, allowing separate pulmonary and systemic circulatory systems, a key requirement for the evolution of endothermy. However, the evolution of the amniote heart is poorly understood. Reptilian hearts have been the subject of debate in the context of the evolution of cardiac septation: do they possess a single ventricular chamber or two incompletely septated ventricles? Here we examine heart development in the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans (a chelonian), and the green anole, Anolis carolinensis (a squamate), focusing on gene expression in the developing ventricles. Both reptiles initially form a ventricular chamber that homogenously expresses the T-box transcription factor gene Tbx5. In contrast, in birds and mammals, Tbx5 is restricted to left ventricle precursors. In later stages, Tbx5 expression in the turtle (but not anole) heart is gradually restricted to a distinct left ventricle, forming a left-right gradient. This suggests that Tbx5 expression was refined during evolution to pattern the ventricles. In support of this hypothesis, we show that loss of Tbx5 in the mouse ventricle results in a single chamber lacking distinct identity, indicating a requirement for Tbx5 in septation. Importantly, misexpression of Tbx5 throughout the developing myocardium to mimic the reptilian expression pattern also results in a single mispatterned ventricular chamber lacking septation. Thus ventricular septation is established by a steep and correctly positioned Tbx5 gradient. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for the evolution of the amniote ventricle, and support the concept that altered expression of developmental regulators is a key mechanism of vertebrate evolution.},

	Abstract = {The reptiles are the last major group of jawed vertebrates in which the organization of the IGH locus and its encoded Ig H chain isotypes have not been well characterized. In this study, we show that the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis) expresses three Ig H chain isotypes (IgM, IgD, and IgY) but no IgA. The presence of the delta gene in the lizard demonstrates an evolutionary continuity of IgD from fishes to mammals. Although the germline delta gene contains 11 C(H) exons, only the first 4 are used in the expressed IgD membrane-bound form. The mu chain lacks the cysteine in C(H)1 that forms a disulfide bond between H and L chains, suggesting that (as in IgM of some amphibians) the H and L polypeptide chains are not covalently associated. Although conventional IgM transcripts (four C(H) domains) encoding both secreted and membrane-bound forms were detected, alternatively spliced transcripts encoding a short membrane-bound form were also observed and shown to lack the first two C(H) domains (VDJ-C(H)3-C(H)4-transmembrane region). Similar to duck IgY, lizard IgY H chain (upsilon) transcripts encoding both full-length and truncated (IgYDeltaFc) forms (with two C(H) domains) were observed. The absence of an IgA-encoding gene in the lizard IGH locus suggests a complex evolutionary history for IgA in the saurian lineage leading to modern birds, lizards, and their relatives.},

	Abstract = {Researchers have suggested that animals should respond more strongly to conspecific than to heterospecific communication signals used in territorial or courtship contexts. We tested this prediction by reviewing studies that appeared in six prominent journals over the past 10 years. A meta-analysis based on these empirical studies revealed that overall support for this hypothesis was weaker than anticipated. To help clarify the extent to which experimental design might contribute to equivocal findings, we performed playback experiments in the field, using robotic lizards. We examined whether male tropical lizards, Anolis gundlachi, responded more strongly to robots producing conspecific territorial advertisement displays than to robots producing equivalent displays of a novel heterospecific. Although this experiment was conducted under natural conditions in the field, at signaler-receiver distances typical for animals at this locality, and with high statistical power, we found that lizards responded just as aggressively to a simulated rival performing a display they had never seen before as to the same rival performing a conspecific display. Our findings suggest that predicting how animals will respond to conspecific versus heterospecific signals is more complicated than has generally been anticipated.},

@article{Cox:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Abstract Survival and reproductive success are determined by the complex interplay between behavior, physiology, morphology, and performance. When optimal trait combinations along these various phenotypic axes differ between sexes or across seasons, regulatory mechanisms such as sex steroids can often facilitate sex-specific and/or seasonal trait expression. In this study, we used surgical castration and replacement of exogenous testosterone in adult male brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) to simultaneously examine the effects of testosterone on a suite of morphological (dewlap area, body size), physiological (immune function), behavioral (dewlap, head bob, and push-up displays), and performance (stamina, sprint speed, bite force) traits. We show that testosterone increases (or castration reduces) growth rate, dewlap area, and bite force. Treatment effects on bite force may simply reflect underlying treatment differences in growth combined with allometry of bite force. Other traits, such as stamina, sprint speed, and rate of behavioral displays, were largely independent of circulating testosterone levels. Although we did not observe significant treatment effects on immune function, we found negative correlations between growth and immune function consistent with the hypothesis that testosterone mediates trade-offs between these competing aspects of energy allocation. Overall, our results demonstrate that testosterone can exert pleiotropic effects on a variety of morphological, physiological, behavioral, and performance traits that are known to influence survival and reproductive success.},

@article{Calsbeek:2010ab,
	Abstract = {A central problem in evolutionary biology is to understand how spatial and temporal variation in selection maintain genetic variation within and among populations. Brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) exhibit a dorsal pattern polymorphism that is expressed only in females, which occur in "diamond,""bar," and intermediate "diamond-bar" morphs. To understand the inheritance of this polymorphism, we conducted a captive breeding study that refuted several single-locus models and supported a two-locus mode of inheritance. To describe geographic variation in morph frequencies, we surveyed 13 populations from two major islands in The Bahamas. Morph frequencies differed substantially between major islands but were highly congruent within each island. Finally, we measured viability selection on each island to test two hypotheses regarding the maintenance of the polymorphism: (1) that spatial variation in selection maintains variation in morph frequencies between islands, and (2) that temporal variation in selection across years maintains variation within islands. Although bar females had relatively lower survival where they were rare, our data do not otherwise suggest that selection varies spatially between islands. However, diamond-bar females were subject to positive frequency-dependent selection across years, and the relative fitness of bar and diamond females alternated across years. We propose that this polymorphism is maintained by temporal variation in selection coupled with the sheltering of alleles via a two-locus inheritance pattern and sex-limited expression.},

@article{Shan:2009aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Crocodilians (Order Crocodylia) are an ancient vertebrate group of tremendous ecological, social, and evolutionary importance. They are the only extant reptilian members of Archosauria, a monophyletic group that also includes birds, dinosaurs, and pterosaurs. Consequently, crocodilian genomes represent a gateway through which the molecular evolution of avian lineages can be explored. To facilitate comparative genomics within Crocodylia and between crocodilians and other archosaurs, we have constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library for the Australian saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus. This is the first BAC library for a crocodile and only the second BAC resource for a crocodilian. RESULTS: The C. porosus BAC library consists of 101,760 individually archived clones stored in 384-well microtiter plates. NotI digestion of random clones indicates an average insert size of 102 kb. Based on a genome size estimate of 2778 Mb, the library affords 3.7 fold (3.7x) coverage of the C. porosus genome. To investigate the utility of the library in studying sequence distribution, probes derived from CR1a and CR1b, two crocodilian CR1-like retrotransposon subfamilies, were hybridized to C. porosus macroarrays. The results indicate that there are a minimum of 20,000 CR1a/b elements in C. porosus and that their distribution throughout the genome is decidedly non-random. To demonstrate the utility of the library in gene isolation, we probed the C. porosus macroarrays with an overgo designed from a C-mos (oocyte maturation factor) partial cDNA. A BAC containing C-mos was identified and the C-mos locus was sequenced. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignment of the C. porosus C-mos coding sequence with avian and reptilian C-mos orthologs reveals greater sequence similarity between C. porosus and birds (specifically chicken and zebra finch) than between C. porosus and squamates (green anole). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the utility of the Crocodylus porosus BAC library as a tool in genomics research. The BAC library should expedite complete genome sequencing of C. porosus and facilitate detailed analysis of genome evolution within Crocodylia and between crocodilians and diverse amniote lineages including birds, mammals, and other non-avian reptiles.},

	Abstract = {Using bioinformatic methods we have detected the genes of 40 keratin-associated beta-proteins (KAbetaPs) (beta-keratins) from the first available draft genome sequence of a reptile, the lizard Anolis carolinensis (Broad Institute, Boston). All genes are clustered in a single but not yet identified chromosomal locus, and contain a single intron of variable length. 5'-RACE and RT-PCR analyses using RNA from different epidermal regions show tissue-specific expression of different transcripts. These results were confirmed from the analysis of the A. carolinensis EST libraries (Broad Institute). Most deduced proteins are 12-16 kDa with a pI of 7.5-8.5. Two genes encoding putative proteins of 40 and 45 kDa are also present. Despite variability in amino acid sequences, four main subfamilies can be described. The largest subfamily includes proteins high in glycine, a small subfamily contains proteins high in cysteine, a third large subfamily contains proteins high in cysteine and glycine, and the fourth, smallest subfamily comprises proteins low in cysteine and glycine. An inner region of high amino acid identity is the most constant characteristic of these proteins and maps to a region with two to three close beta-folds in the proteins. This beta-fold region is responsible for the formation of filaments of the corneous material in all types of scales in this species. Phylogenetic analysis shows that A. carolinensis KAbetaPs are more similar to those of other lepidosaurians (snake, lizard, and gecko lizard) than to those of archosaurians (chick and crocodile) and turtles.},

	Abstract = {The integration of macroevolutionary pattern with developmental mechanism presents an outstanding challenge for studies of phenotypic evolution. Here, we use a combination of experimental and comparative data to test whether evolutionary shifts in the direction of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) correspond to underlying changes in the endocrine regulation of growth. First, we combine captive breeding studies with mark-recapture data to show that male-biased SSD develops in the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) because males grow significantly faster than females as juveniles and adults. We then use castration surgeries and testosterone implants to show that castration inhibits, and testosterone stimulates, male growth. We conclude by reviewing published testosterone manipulations in other squamate reptiles in the context of evolutionary patterns in SSD. Collectively, these studies reveal that the evolution of SSD has been accompanied by underlying changes in the effect of testosterone on male growth, potentially facilitating the rapid evolution of SSD.},

	Abstract = {Little is known about the impact of increased metabolism on body temperatures of small ectotherms. We found that postprandial metabolic rates of 5 g Anolis carolinensis lizards were elevated by factorial increases of 2.3+/-1.0 (mean+/-S.E.) at 26 degrees C and 3.8+/-2.1 at 30 degrees C over their fasting rates. Cloacal body temperatures exceeded environmental temperatures by a small amount in fasted individuals (26 degrees C: 0.3+/-0.02 degrees C, 30 degrees C: 0.3+/-0.02 degrees C), and by a significantly larger amount in fed individuals (26 degrees C: 1.0+/-0.06 degrees C, 30 degrees C: 0.8+/-0.08 degrees C). We conclude that an increased metabolic rate due to specific dynamic action leads to a small but significant elevation of body temperature in this species. Comparisons with thermal increments reported for a large (750 g) varanid lizard suggest that body size has only a minor influence on body-air temperature differentials of ectotherms. This is consistent with theoretical predictions. Finally, endogenous heat production could help elevate body temperatures in the wild and therefore play a minor role in thermoregulation.},

@article{Gambon-Deza:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Immunoglobulins loci in mammals are well known to be organized within a translocon, however their origin remains unresolved. Four of the five classes of immunoglobulins described in humans and rodents (immunoglobulins M, G, E and A-IgM, IgG, IgE and IgA) were found in marsupials and monotremes (immunoglobulin D-IgD was not found) thus showing that the genomic structure of antibodies in mammals has remained constant since its origin. We have recently described the genomic organization of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus in reptiles (IGHM, IGHD and IGHY). These data and the characterization of the IGH locus in platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), allow us to elucidate the changes that took place in this genomic region during evolution from reptile to mammal. Thus, by using available genome data, we were able to detect that platypus IGH locus contains reptilian and mammalian genes. Besides having an IGHD that is very similar to the one in reptiles and an IGHY, they also present the mammal specific antibody genes IGHG and IGHE, in addition to IGHA. We also detected a pseudogene that originated by recombination between the IGHD and the IGHM (similar to the IGHD2 found in Eublepharis macularius). The analysis of the IGH locus in platypus shows that IGHY was duplicated, firstly by evolving into IGHE and then into IGHG. The IGHA of the platypus has a complex origin, and probably arose by a process of recombination between the IGHM and the IGHY. We detected about 44 VH genes (25 were already described), most of which comprise a single group. When we compared these VH genes with those described in Anolis carolinensis, we find that there is an evolutionary relationship between the VH genes of platypus and the reptilian Group III genes. These results suggest that a fast VH turnover took place in platypus and this gave rise to a family with a high VH gene number and the disappearance of the earlier VH families.},

	Abstract = {Testicular tissues from Anolis lineatopus were examined histologically to determine testicular structure, germ cell morphologies, and the germ cell development strategy employed during spermatogenesis. Anoles (N=36) were collected from southern Jamaica from October 2004 to September 2005. Testes were extracted and fixed in Trump's fixative, dehydrated, embedded in Spurr's plastic, sectioned, and stained with basic fuchsin/toluidine blue. The testes of Jamaican Anoles were composed of seminiferous tubules lined with seminiferous epithelia, similar to birds and mammals, and were spermatogenically active during every month of the year. However, spermatogenic activity fluctuated based on morphometric data for February, May and June, and September-December. Sequential increases for these months and decreases in between months in tubular diameters and epithelial heights were due to fluctuations in number of elongating spermatids and spermiation events. Cellular associations were not observed during spermatogenesis in A. lineatopus, and three or more spermatids coincided with mitotic and meiotic cells within the seminiferous epithelium. Although the germ cell generations were layered within the seminiferous epithelium, similar to birds and mammals, the actual temporal development of germ cells and bursts of sperm release more closely resembled that reported recently for other reptilian taxa. All of these reptiles were temperate species that showed considerable seasonality in terms of testis morphology and spermatogenesis. The Jamaican Gray Anole has continuous spermatogenesis yet maintains this temporal germ cell development pattern. Thus, a lack of seasonal spermatogenesis in this anole seems to have no influence on the germ cell development strategy employed during sperm development.},

@article{Kozak:2009aa,
	Abstract = {A classic paradigm in evolutionary biology is that geographically isolated clades inhabiting similar selective regimes will diversify to create similar sets of phenotypes in different locations (e.g., similar stickleback species in different lakes, similar Anolis ecomorphs on different islands). Such parallel radiations are not generally expected to occur in sympatry because the available niche space would be filled by whichever clade is diversified first. Here, we document a very different pattern, the parallel evolution of similar body-size morphs in three sympatric clades of plethodontid salamanders (Desmognathus, Plethodon, Spelerpinae) in eastern North America. Using a comprehensive, time-calibrated phylogeny of North American plethodontids from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences, we show that these three clades have undergone replicated patterns of evolution in body size and that this parallel diversification occurred in broad-scale sympatry. At the local scale, we find that coexisting species from these clades are more similar in body size than expected under a null model in which species are randomly assembled into communities. These patterns are particularly surprising in that competition is known to be important in driving phenotypic diversification and limiting local coexistence of similar-sized species within these clades. Although parallel diversification of sympatric clades may seem counterintuitive, we discuss several ecological and evolutionary factors that may allow the phenomenon to occur.},

@article{Beck:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Estradiol (E2) is important in activation of male reproductive behaviors, and masculinizes morphology of associated brain regions in a number of mammalian and avian species. In contrast, it is testosterone, rather than its metabolites, that is the most potent activator of male sexual behavior in green anole lizards. As in other vertebrate groups, however, E2 is critical for receptivity in females of this species. Aromatase, the enzyme which converts testosterone to E2, is more active in the male than female green anole brain, and appears to be actively regulated on a seasonal basis, suggesting some role for E2 in males. This study was designed to enhance our understanding of potential E2 actions by localizing and quantifying relative levels of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) mRNA in forebrain regions involved in masculine and feminine behaviors in anoles. These areas include the preoptic area (POA), ventromedial amygdala (AMY) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). In situ hybridization was conducted in adult males and females collected during both breeding and non-breeding seasons. ERalpha mRNA was expressed in each brain region across sexes and seasons. However, expression was up to 3 times greater in the VMH compared to the POA and AMY. In the POA and VMH, expression was higher in females compared to males, independent of season. The increased receptor expression in females is consistent with E2 playing a larger role in female than male reproductive behaviors.},

@article{Abdala:2009aa,
	Abstract = {In lizards, distinct patterns of the tendinous structures associated with the forearm flexors have been described. In most lizards, the m. flexor digitorum longus ends in a tendinous plate with an embedded sesamoid, from which tendons run to the terminal phalanx of each digit. This structure is known as the flexor plate. In many polychrotid lizards, however, the flexor digitorum longus muscle is continuous with individual tendons running to each digit, and no complete flexor plate is present. In most geckos, the flexor plate is reduced to a tendinous plate without sesamoid. To evaluate the consequences of these differences in morphology on locomotion and grasping, we compared the use of the fore-arm and hand in lizards exhibiting three different tendon patterns (Pogona vitticeps, an agamid with a well-developed flexor plate; Gekko gecko, a gekkonid with a flexor plate, but without an embedded sesamoid; Anolis equestris, a polychrotid without flexor plate, but showing independent tendons running to each digit) while moving on different substrates. We found that the presence of a flexor plate with sesamoid bone prevents digital flexion and creates a rather stiff palmar surface in P. vitticeps. This configuration makes it impossible for P. vitticeps to grasp narrow branches and results in a strongly impaired locomotor performance on narrow substrates. Both G. gecko and A. equestris can flex the palms of their hands and their fingers more extensively, and do so when moving on narrow substrates. We suggest that the reduction of the flexor plate in both G. gecko and A. equestris allows these animals to move effectively on narrow substrates.},

	Abstract = {Extreme morphologies of many insular taxa suggest that islands have unusual properties that influence the tempo and mode of evolution. Yet whether insularity per se promotes rapid phenotypic evolution remains largely untested. We extend a phylogenetic comparative approach to test the influence of novel environments versus insularity on rates of body size and sexual size dimorphism diversification in Anolis. Rates of body size diversification among small-island and mainland species were similar to those of anole species on the Greater Antilles. However, the Greater Antilles taxa that colonized small islands and the mainland are ecologically nonrandom: rates of body size diversification among small-island and mainland species are high compared to their large-island sister taxa. Furthermore, rates of diversification in sexual size dimorphism on small islands are high compared to all large-island and mainland lineages. We suggest that elevated diversifying selection, particularly as a result of ecological release, may drive high rates of body size diversification in both small-island and mainland novel environments. In contrast, high abundance (prevalent among small-island lizard communities) mediating intraspecific resource competition and male-male competition may explain why sexual size dimorphism diversifies faster among small-island lineages than among their mainland and large-island relatives.},

We have obtained the full cDNA sequences that encode Japanese eel and rainbow trout apo-14 kDa. Homologues of Japanese eel apo-14 kDa sequence could be found in 14 fish species deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank or TGI database. Fish apo-14 kDa lacks propeptide and contains more internal repeats than mammalian apoA-II. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analysis allowed fish apo-14 kDa to be the homologue of mammalian apoA-II. In addition, in silico cloning of the TGI, Ensembl, or NCBI database revealed apoA-IIs in dog, chicken, green anole lizard, and African clawed frog whose sequences had not so far been available, suggesting both apoA-I and apoA-II as fundamental constituents of vertebrate HDLs.},

	Abstract = {Kisspeptins are a recently identified class of neuropeptides belonging to the RFamide peptide family. Despite growing evidence supporting kisspeptin as a key regulator of reproduction, data addressing whether kisspeptin is a conserved reproductive signal are lacking. We investigated the distribution of kisspeptin in adult green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) via immunohistochemistry. Additionally, we examined the possibility of a sexual dimorphism in kisspeptin expression. Kisspeptin immunoreactivity was observed rostrally in the preoptic area and caudally in an area lateral to the dorsal hypothalamic nucleus in both male and female anoles. These kisspeptin immunoreactive cells are associated with vesiculated fibers traveling through the paraventricular zone of the hypothalamus and preoptic area and extending into the rostral telencephalon. Preabsorption of the antiserum with gonadotropin inhibitory hormone (GnIH), a second RFamide peptide known to cross-react with the kisspeptin antiserum, eliminated staining of the caudal population of cells but retained staining in the rostral population, suggesting that kisspeptin is present in this area. Preabsorption with kisspeptin eliminated all immunoreactivity. These preabsorption results suggest that kisspeptin is restricted to a single population in the preoptic area in anoles. No sex differences were found in kisspeptin immunoreactive cell number. The presence of kisspeptin RFamide peptide in the green anole suggests that this reproductive regulatory signal is indeed evolutionarily conserved. Whether this reproductive signal functions similarly in regulating the reproductive axis of ectotherms requires further study.},

	Abstract = {The genome of the lizard Anolis carolinensis (the green anole) is the first nonavian reptilian genome sequenced. It offers a unique opportunity to comparatively examine the evolution of amniote genomes. We analyzed the abundance and diversity of non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons in the anole using the Genome Parsing Suite. We found that the anole genome contains an extraordinary diversity of elements. We identified 46 families of elements representing five clades (L1, L2, CR1, RTE, and R4). Within most families, elements are very similar to each other suggesting that they have been inserted recently. The rarity of old elements suggests a high rate of turnover, the insertion of new elements being offset by the loss of element-containing loci. Consequently, non-LTR retrotransposons accumulate in the anole at a low rate and are found in low copy number. This pattern of diversity shows some striking similarity with the genome of teleostean fish but contrasts greatly with the low diversity and high copy number of mammalian L1 elements, suggesting a fundamental difference in the way mammals and nonmammalian vertebrates interact with their genomic parasites. The scarcity of divergent elements in anoles suggests that insertions have a deleterious effect and are eliminated by natural selection. We propose that the low abundance of non-LTR retrotransposons in the anole is related directly or indirectly to a higher rate of ectopic recombination in the anole relative to mammals.},

	Abstract = {Biological impacts of climate warming are predicted to increase with latitude, paralleling increases in warming. However, the magnitude of impacts depends not only on the degree of warming but also on the number of species at risk, their physiological sensitivity to warming and their options for behavioural and physiological compensation. Lizards are useful for evaluating risks of warming because their thermal biology is well studied. We conducted macrophysiological analyses of diurnal lizards from diverse latitudes plus focal species analyses of Puerto Rican Anolis and Sphaerodactyus. Although tropical lowland lizards live in environments that are warm all year, macrophysiological analyses indicate that some tropical lineages (thermoconformers that live in forests) are active at low body temperature and are intolerant of warm temperatures. Focal species analyses show that some tropical forest lizards were already experiencing stressful body temperatures in summer when studied several decades ago. Simulations suggest that warming will not only further depress their physiological performance in summer, but will also enable warm-adapted, open-habitat competitors and predators to invade forests. Forest lizards are key components of tropical ecosystems, but appear vulnerable to the cascading physiological and ecological effects of climate warming, even though rates of tropical warming may be relatively low.},

	Abstract = {1. Dispersal behaviour is a potentially risky life-history strategy that can impact habitat use as well as competition over territories and mates. 2. I studied natural selection on dispersal behaviour over the course of four breeding seasons in a Bahamian population of brown anoles (Anolis sagrei). 3. Both males and females showed extremely high site fidelity over the course of each reproductive season. Movement distance in males was negatively correlated with body size at first capture in spring (small males dispersed further). Moreover, differences in body size between dispersing males and the body size of the male territory residents that they replaced were correlated with the distance that males dispersed. Relatively larger males dispersed shorter distances compared with relatively smaller males. There was no relationship between dispersal distance and body size in females. However, females were more likely to disperse away from areas of low female density and into areas of higher female density, and female dispersal distances were negatively correlated with the number of female neighbours at the site of capture in spring (before dispersal). 4. These data suggest that, whereas male dispersal is driven by inter-male competition, female dispersal is more likely related to variation in territory quality. 5. Natural selection acted on dispersal distance in conjunction with male, but not female body size. Although smaller males were the more likely to disperse, these males paid a high cost in terms of viability indicating that dispersal is a potentially risky strategy.},

	Abstract = {We describe the entire immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus from the reptile Anolis carolinensis. The heavy chain constant (C(H)) region includes C mu, C delta and C upsilon genes. This is the first description of a C upsilon gene in the reptilian class. Variable (V(H)), diversity (D(H)) and joining (J(H)) genes are located 5' from the constant (C(H)) chain complex locus. The C mu and C upsilon genes encode antibodies with four immunoglobulin domains. The C delta gene encoded an 11 domain delta heavy chain as in Eublepharis macularius. Seventy V(H) genes, belonging to 28 families, were identified, and they can be sorted into five broader groups. The similarity of the organization of the reptilian genes with those of amphibians and mammals suggests the existence of a process of heavy chain genomic reorganization before the radiation of tetrapod vertebrates.},

@article{Beck:2009ab,
	Abstract = {Steroid hormones, especially estradiol, facilitate reproductive behaviors in male and female rodents and birds. In green anole lizards estradiol facilitates receptivity in females but, unlike in some other species, is not the activating hormone for courtship and copulatory behavior in males. Instead, testicular androgens directly facilitate male courtship and copulation. Yet, activity of the estradiol synthesizing enzyme aromatase is higher in the brain of male than female green anoles, and it is increased during the breeding compared to the non-breeding season. The functional relevance of these differences in local estradiol production is unknown. They might prime the male forebrain to facilitate production of appropriate sexual behaviors, perhaps by modifying morphology of relevant brain regions. In addition, we recently reported increased expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) in selected brain regions in females compared to males [Beck LA, Wade J (2009b) Sexually dimorphic estrogen receptor alpha mRNA expression in the preoptic area and ventromedial hypothalamus of green anole lizards. 55:398-403]. Thus, it is possible that the hormone serves to downregulate its receptor in males to inhibit the expression of estradiol-dependent receptive behaviors. To begin to address these ideas, the present study examines the effects of estradiol treatment, sex, and season on forebrain morphology and ERalpha mRNA abundance in three regions important for anole reproductive behavior-the preoptic area, ventromedial amygdala, and ventromedial hypothalamus. While a number of effects of sex and season on forebrain morphology were detected, direct effects of estradiol treatment on these measures were minimal. ERalpha expression was greatest in the ventromedial hypothalamus, and a large female-biased sex difference was detected in this area alone; it resulted from estradiol-treated animals. These results indicate a sex- and region-specific mechanism by which estradiol can modify ERalpha expression in the green anole and could impact the expression of female-typical receptivity.},

@article{Huang:2008aa,
	Abstract = {The brown anole ( Anolis sagrei ) occurs naturally in various localities in Central America, and an exotic invasive population was first reported in Sheishan District, Chiayi County, Taiwan, in 2000. Previous studies showed that following the invasion of A. sagrei , the diversity and abundance of local terrestrial arthropods, such as orb spiders and arboreal insects, were severely affected. In this study, we assessed the impact of A. sagrei on arthropod diversity in Taiwan by comparing spider and insect diversities among betelnut palm plantations, in which this lizard species was either present or absent, and a secondary forest. In addition, enclosures were established in which the density of A. sagrei was manipulated to investigate the effect of this predator on spiders. The results of a lizard stomach content analysis showed that spiders comprised 7% and insects 90% of the prey consumed. Among the insects consumed by A. sagrei , more than 50% were ants. The abundances of the major arthropod prey of A. sagrei , such as jumping spiders and hymenopterans, in the lizard-present sites were much lower than in the lizard-removed sites. The enclosure experiments also showed that predation by the lizards significantly reduced the abundance of jumping spiders. All these results indicated that the introduced lizard greatly affected the diversity and abundance of terrestrial arthropods in agricultural areas in southern Taiwan.},

@article{Montuelle:2009aa,
	Abstract = {In tetrapods, feeding behaviour in general, and prey capture in particular, involves two anatomical systems: the feeding system and the locomotor system. Although the kinematics associated with the movements of each system have been investigated in detail independently, the actual integration between the two systems has received less attention. Recently, the independence of the movements of the jaw and locomotor systems was reported during tongue-based prey capture in an iguanian lizard (Anolis carolinensis), suggesting a decoupling between the two systems. Jaw prehension, on the other hand, can be expected to be dependent on the movements of the locomotor system to a greater degree. To test for the presence of functional coupling and integration between the jaw and locomotor systems, we used the cordyliform lizard Gerrhosaurus major as a model species because it uses both tongue and jaw prehension. Based on a 3-D kinematic analysis of the movements of the jaws, the head, the neck and the forelimbs during the approach and capture of prey, we demonstrate significant correlations between the movements of the trophic and the locomotor systems. However, this integration differs between prehension modes in the degree and the nature of the coupling. In contrast to our expectations and previous data for A. carolinensis, our data indicate a coupling between feeding and locomotor systems during tongue prehension. We suggest that the functional integration between the two systems while using the tongue may be a consequence of the relatively slow nature of tongue prehension in this species.},

	Abstract = {Hox genes control many aspects of embryonic development in metazoans. Previous analyses of this gene family revealed a surprising diversity in terms of gene number and organization between various animal species. In vertebrates, Hox genes are grouped into tightly organized clusters, claimed to be devoid of repetitive sequences. Here, we report the genomic organization of the four Hox loci present in the green anole lizard and show that they have massively accumulated retrotransposons, leading to gene clusters larger in size when compared to other vertebrates. In addition, similar repeats are present in many other development-related gene-containing regions, also thought to be refractory to such repetitive elements. Transposable elements are major sources of genetic variations, including alterations of gene expression, and hence this situation, so far unique among vertebrates, may have been associated with the evolution of the spectacular realm of morphological variations in the body plans of Squamata. Finally, sequence alignments highlight some divergent evolution in highly conserved DNA regions between vertebrate Hox clusters, which may coincide with the emergence of mammalian-specific features.},

@article{Jackman:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Cone photoreceptors distinguish small changes in light intensity while operating over a wide dynamic range. The cone synapse encodes intensity by modulating tonic neurotransmitter release, but precise encoding is limited by the quantal nature of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Cones possess synaptic ribbons, structures that are thought to accelerate the delivery of vesicles for tonic release. Here we show that the synaptic ribbon actually constrains vesicle delivery, resulting in a maintained state of synaptic depression in darkness. Electron microscopy of cones from the lizard Anolis segrei revealed that depression is caused by the depletion of vesicles on the ribbon, indicating that resupply, not fusion, is the rate-limiting step that controls release. Responses from postsynaptic retinal neurons from the salamander Ambystoma tigrinum showed that the ribbon behaves like a capacitor, charging with vesicles in light and discharging in a phasic burst at light offset. Phasic release extends the operating range of the cone synapse to more accurately encode changes in light intensity, accentuating features that are salient to photopic vision.},

	Abstract = {Voluntary loss of an appendage, or autotomy, is a remarkable behavior that is widespread among many arthropods and lower vertebrates. Its immediate benefit, generally escape from a predator, is balanced by various costs, including impaired locomotor performance, reproductive success and long-term survival. Among vertebrates, autotomy is most widespread in lizards, in which tail loss has been documented in close to 100 species. Despite numerous studies of the potential costs of tail autotomy in lizards, none have focused on the importance of the tail in jumping. Using high-speed video we recorded jumps from six lizards (Anolis carolinensis) both before and after removing 80% of the tail to test the hypothesis that tail loss has a significant effect on jumping kinematics. Several key performance metrics, including jump distance and takeoff velocity, were not affected by experimental tail removal, averaging 21 cm and 124 cm s(-1), respectively, in both tailed and tailless lizards. However, in-air stability during jumping was greatly compromised after tail removal. Lizards without tails rotated posteriorly more than 30 deg., on average, between takeoff and landing (and sometimes more than 90 deg.) compared with an average of 5 deg. of rotation in lizards with intact tails. Such exaggerated posterior rotation prevents coordinated landing, which is critical for animals that spend much of their time jumping to and from small branches. This work augments recent experiments demonstrating the importance of the tail as a mid-air stabilizer during falling in geckos, and emphasizes new and severe functional costs associated with tail autotomy in arboreal lizards.},

	Abstract = {Animal signalling systems are extremely diverse as they are under different, often conflicting, selective pressures. A classic textbook example of a diverse signal is the anoline dewlap. Both at the inter- and intraspecific levels, dewlap size, colour, shape and pattern vary extensively. Here, we attempt to elucidate the various factors explaining the diversity in dewlap size and pattern among seven Anolis sagrei populations from different islands in the Bahamas. The seven islands differ in the surface area, number and kind of predators, sexual size dimorphism and Anolis species composition. In addition, we investigate whether selective pressures acting on dewlap design differ between males and females. Whereas dewlap pattern appears to serve a role in species recognition in both sexes, our data suggest that relative dewlap size is under natural and/or sexual selection. We find evidence for the role of the dewlap as a pursuit-deterrence signal in both males and females as relative dewlap size is larger on islands where A. sagrei occurs sympatrically with predatory Leiocephalus lizards. Additionally, in males relatively large dewlaps seem to be selected for in a sexual context, whereas in females natural selection, for instance by other predators than Leiocephalus lizards, appears to constrain relative dewlap size.},

	Abstract = {We have isolated and characterised sequences of a SINE family specific for squamate reptiles from a genome of lacertid lizard that we called Squam1. Copies are 360-390 bp in length and share a significant similarity with tRNA gene sequence on its 5'-end. This family was also detected by us in DNA of representatives of varanids, iguanids (anolis), gekkonids, and snakes. No signs of it were found in DNA of mammals, birds, amphibians, and crocodiles. Detailed analysis of primary structure of the retroposons obtained by us from genomic libraries or GenBank sequences was carried out. Most taxa possess 2-3 subfamilies of the SINE in their genomes with specific diagnostic features in their primary structure. Individual variability of copies in different families is about 85% and is just slightly lower on the genera level. Comparison of consensus sequences on family level reveals a high degree of structural similarity with a number of specific apomorphic features which makes it a useful marker of phylogeny for this group of reptiles. Snakes do not show specific affinity to varanids when compared to other lizards, as it was suggested earlier.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural selection is a potent evolutionary force that shapes phenotypic variation to match ecological conditions. However, we know little about the year-to-year consistency of selection, or how inter-annual variation in ecology shapes adaptive landscapes and ultimately adaptive radiations. Here we combine remote sensing data, field experiments, and a four-year study of natural selection to show that changes in vegetation structure associated with a severe drought altered both habitat use and natural selection in the brown anole, Anolis sagrei. RESULTS: In natural populations, lizards increased their use of vegetation in wet years and this was correlated with selection on limb length but not body size. By contrast, a die-back of vegetation caused by drought was followed by reduced arboreality, selection on body size, and relaxed selection on limb length. With the return of the rains and recovery of vegetation, selection reverted back to pre-drought pattern of selection acting on limb length but not body size. To test for the impact of vegetation loss on natural selection during the drought, we experimentally removed vegetation on a separate study island in a naturally wet year. The experiment revealed similar inter-annual changes in selection on body size but not limb length. CONCLUSION: Our results illustrate the dynamic nature of ecology driving natural selection on Anolis morphology and emphasize the importance of inter-annual environmental variation in shaping adaptive variation. In addition, results illustrate the utility of using remote sensing data to examine ecology's role in driving natural selection.},

@article{Johansson:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Populations of the Caribbean lizard, Anolis roquet, are thought to have experienced long periods of allopatry before recent secondary contact. To elucidate the effects of past allopatry on population divergence in A. roquet, we surveyed parallel transects across a secondary contact zone in northeastern Martinique. We used diagnostic molecular mitochondrial DNA markers to test fine-scale association of mitochondrial DNA lineage and geological region, multivariate statistical techniques to explore quantitative trait pattern, and cline fitting techniques to model trait variation across the zone of secondary contact. We found that lineages were strongly associated with geological regions along both transects, but quantitative trait patterns were remarkably different. Patterns of morphological and mitochondrial DNA variation were consistent with a strong barrier to gene flow on the coast, whereas there were no indications of barriers to gene flow in the transitional forest. Hence, the coastal populations behaved as would be predicted by an allopatric model of divergence in this complex, while those in the transitional forest did not, despite the close proximity of the transects and their shared geological history. Patterns of geographical variation in this species complex, together with environmental data, suggest that on balance, selection regimes on either side of the secondary contact zone in the transitional forest may be more convergent, while those either side of the secondary contact zone on the coast are more divergent. Hence, the evolutionary consequences of allopatry may be strongly influenced by local natural selection regimes.},

@article{Calsbeek:2009ac,
	Abstract = {A key prediction made by theories of density-dependent competition is that resource overlap should increase the intensity of competition. By extension, we can predict that competition should lead to density-dependent natural selection. I studied natural selection on limb length and body size in a total of seven populations of Anolis sagrei over 3 years in the Bahamas. Experimental manipulations of population density on small off-shore cays revealed that the strength of natural selection on body size increased with density, suggesting that density-dependent intraspecific competition drives natural selection. At low density, reduced competition revealed significant selection on limb length driven by changes in perch diameter, indicating that selection favoured a match between morphology and habitat. The role habitat played in shaping selection was further illuminated by inter-annual changes in vegetation structure stemming from variation in precipitation among years. Thus, changes in both the intensity of competition across spatial replicates, and in resource availability through time, revealed changes in the targets of natural selection. Results provide empirical support for the long-standing hypothesis that density-dependent natural selection shapes the fitness surface of Greater Antilles anoles.},

	Abstract = {Transposable elements have been characterized in a number of vertebrates, including whole genomes of mammals, birds, and fishes. The Anolis carolinensis draft assembly provides the first opportunity to study retroposons in a reptilian genome. Here, we identified and reconstructed a number of retroposons based on database searches: Five Sauria short interspersed element (SINE) subfamilies, 5S-Sauria SINE chimeras, Anolis Bov-B long interspersed element (LINE), Anolis SINE 2, Anolis LINE 2, Anolis LINE 1, Anolis CR 1, and a chromodomain-containing Ty3/Gypsy LTR element. We focused on two SINE families (Anolis Sauria SINE and Anolis SINE 2) and their partner LINE families (Anolis Bov-B LINE and Anolis LINE 2). We demonstrate that each SINE/LINE pair is distributed similarly and predict that the retrotransposition of evolutionarily younger Sauria SINE members is via younger Bov-B LINE members while a correlation also exists between their respective evolutionarily older SINE/LINE members. The evolutionarily youngest Sauria SINE sequences evolved as part of novel rolling-circle transposons. The evolutionary time frame when Bov-B LINEs and Sauria SINEs were less active in their retrotransposition is characterized by a high retrotransposition burst of Anolis SINE 2 and Anolis LINE 2 elements. We also characterized the first full-length chromoviral LTR element in amniotes (Amn-ichi). This newly identified chromovirus is widespread in the Anolis genome and has been very well preserved, indicating that it is still active. Transposable elements in the Anolis genome account for approximately 20% of the total DNA sequence, whereas the proportion is more than double that in many mammalian genomes in which such elements have important biological functions. Nevertheless, 20% transposable element coverage is sufficient to predict that Anolis retroposons and other mobile elements also may have biologically and evolutionarily relevant functions. The new SINEs and LINEs and other ubiquitous genomic elements characterized in the Anolis genome will prove very useful for studies in comparative genomics, phylogenetics, and functional genetics.},

	Abstract = {Plasmodium floridense is a saurian malaria parasite common in the Anolis lizards of the northern Caribbean islands and the SE USA. In the latter area, it is found in two native lizards (Sceloporus undulatus and Anolis carolinensis) and in the introduced Anolis sagrei, which is native to Cuba. We measured parasite prevalence and parasitemia in the introduced anole at a single site in North Port, Florida over 5 years. Prevalence, based on microscopic examination of blood smears, was high year-round (45.6% of adult lizards infected) but was highest in the two December collections and showed significant variation over time. The parasitemia of the P. floridense infections was extremely low, however, with a median of only three parasites per 1,000 red blood cells in infected lizards. This combination of high prevalence and low parasitemia suggests chronic infections for individual lizards and an endemic prevalence pattern. Our study also underscores the need for long-term studies to establish overall prevalence in malarial parasite systems.},

To address this issue, brain region volume, cell density, soma size, and estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) mRNA expression were characterized in the preoptic area (POA), ventromedial amygdala (AMY), and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of late embryonic and early post-hatchling anoles. In adulthood, the POA and AMY are associated with male-specific reproductive behaviors and the VMH is implicated in female receptivity. Although soma size decreased in all brain regions with age, brain region volume diminished only in the POA, with a transient sex difference appearing before hatching. Cell density increased with age only in the female AMY. ERalpha mRNA expression was up to four times greater in the developing VMH than POA and AMY, peaking in the VMH around the day of hatching. These results are consistent with the idea that estradiol may influence differentiation of the VMH in particular. However, other factors are likely important to the development of these three brain regions, some of which exert their effects at later developmental stages.},

	Abstract = {Environmental noise that reduces the probability that animals will detect communicative signals poses a special challenge for long-range communication. The application of signal-detection theory to animal communication lead to the prediction that signals directed at distant receivers in noisy environments will begin with conspicuous "alerting" components to attract the attention of receivers, before delivery of the information-rich portion of the signal. Whether animals actually adopt this strategy is not clear, despite suggestions that alerts might exist in a variety of taxa. By using a combination of behavioral observations and experimental manipulations with robotic lizard "playbacks," we show that free-living territorial Anolis lizards add an "alert" to visual displays when communicating to distant receivers in situations of poor visibility, and that these introductory alerts in turn enhance signal detection in adverse signaling conditions. Our results show that Anolis lizards are able to evaluate environmental conditions that affect the degradation of long-distance signals and adjust their behavior accordingly. This study demonstrates that free-living animals enhance the efficiency of long-range communication through the modulation of signal design and the facultative addition of an alert. Our findings confirm that alert signals are an important strategy for communicating in "noisy" conditions and suggest a reexamination of the existence of alerts in other animals relying on long-range communication.},

	Abstract = {Circulating plasma levels of testosterone often differ among social classes of sexually mature males within a population, but the general physiological mechanisms underlying such differences remain unclear. Within sexually mature male green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), smaller "lightweight" males have on average relatively smaller heads, lower bite-forces, and lower testosterone levels compared with larger "heavyweight" males. We conducted gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) challenges on lightweight and heavyweight males to determine if lightweight males were capable of producing comparable levels of circulating testosterone to heavyweight males but are socially or physiologically suppressed from doing so. We challenged lightweight and heavyweight males with chicken I and II GnRH and measured their resulting levels of testosterone and corticosterone. Neither lightweights nor heavyweights increased circulating testosterone levels after GnRH challenge, suggesting they are already at maximal production levels, consistent with the Challenge Hypothesis. Instead, testosterone levels tended to decrease and corticosterone levels increased, most likely owing to the stress response associated with handling. Our results are dramatically different from GnRH challenges conducted in bird species, suggesting that more field studies are needed in reptilian systems.},

	Abstract = {The appearance of hair is one of the main evolutionary innovations in the amniote lineage leading to mammals. The main components of mammalian hair are cysteine-rich type I and type II keratins, also known as hard alpha-keratins or "hair keratins." To determine the evolutionary history of these important structural proteins, we compared the genomic loci of the human hair keratin genes with the homologous loci of the chicken and of the green anole lizard Anolis carolinenis. The genome of the chicken contained one type II hair keratin-like gene, and the lizard genome contained two type I and four type II hair keratin-like genes. Orthology of the latter genes and mammalian hair keratins was supported by gene locus synteny, conserved exon-intron organization, and amino acid sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. The lizard hair keratin-like genes were expressed most strongly in the digits, indicating a role in claw formation. In addition, we identified a novel group of reptilian cysteine-rich type I keratins that lack homologues in mammals. Our data show that cysteine-rich alpha-keratins are not restricted to mammals and suggest that the evolution of mammalian hair involved the co-option of pre-existing structural proteins.},

	Abstract = {Male Anolis carolinensis that win aggressive interactions mobilize neuroendocrine responses to social stress more rapidly than defeated lizards. We initially examined temporal patterns of neuroendocrine response to restraint stress in lizards of unknown status, and then investigated whether winning males respond more rapidly to this non-social stressor. Size-matched male pairs interacted to establish social status, and then were returned to individual home cages for 3 days. Plasma and brains were collected from non-restrained dominants and subordinates, and from a non-interacting control group. Additional groups of dominants and subordinates underwent 90 s restraint stress, with plasma and brains collected either immediately or 300 s after restraint. In lizards of unknown social status restraint stimulated rapid monoaminergic responses in nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, amygdala, and locus ceruleus, with delayed responses seen in VTA and raphe. Non-restrained dominants and subordinates had lower levels of raphe serotonergic activity and lower hippocampal dopaminergic activity 3 days after interacting, compared to controls. Dominants had higher corticosterone levels, both immediately and 300 s after restraint, than either non-restrained dominants or restrained subordinates. Restraint induced higher raphe serotonergic activity in dominants. However, subordinates also showed rapid responses to restraint; exhibiting lower hippocampal dopamine (DA) levels than non-restrained subordinates. At 300 s after the stress, amygdalar serotonin levels increased in dominants, while subordinates showed higher amygdalar DA levels. These results suggest that stressful aggressive interactions will not only alter basal neurochemical activity, but also influence neuroendocrine responses to non-social stressors according to individual social status.},

	Abstract = {Horizontal transfer (HT) is central to the evolution of prokaryotic species. Selfish and mobile genetic elements, such as phages, plasmids, and transposons, are the primary vehicles for HT among prokaryotes. In multicellular eukaryotes, the prevalence and evolutionary significance of HT remain unclear. Here, we identified a set of DNA transposon families dubbed SPACE INVADERS (or SPIN) whose consensus sequences are approximately 96% identical over their entire length (2.9 kb) in the genomes of murine rodents (rat/mouse), bushbaby (prosimian primate), little brown bat (laurasiatherian), tenrec (afrotherian), opossum (marsupial), and two non-mammalian tetrapods (anole lizard and African clawed frog). In contrast, SPIN elements were undetectable in other species represented in the sequence databases, including 19 other mammals with draft whole-genome assemblies. This patchy distribution, coupled with the extreme level of SPIN identity in widely divergent tetrapods and the overall lack of selective constraint acting on these elements, is incompatible with vertical inheritance, but strongly indicative of multiple horizontal introductions. We show that these germline infiltrations likely occurred around the same evolutionary time (15-46 mya) and spawned some of the largest bursts of DNA transposon activity ever recorded in any species lineage (nearly 100,000 SPIN copies per haploid genome in tenrec). The process also led to the emergence of a new gene in the murine lineage derived from a SPIN transposase. In summary, HT of DNA transposons has contributed significantly to shaping and diversifying the genomes of multiple mammalian and tetrapod species.},

	Abstract = {The neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) and its mammalian homologue arginine vasopressin (AVP) are believed to be involved in many social behaviors including territorial aggression. Testosterone (T) is also important for controlling territorial aggression, and it is believed to be involved in modulating AVT/AVP levels in the brain. In this study, male Anolis carolinensis were paired (n=11 pairs) in a neutral cage and were allowed to establish a dominant-subordinate relationship for 10 days (experimental groups) or housed in a neutral cage with or without a female (control groups; each n=4). On 10th day animals were sacrificed and their brain sections were processed for AVT immunohistochemistry and their serum was analyzed for testosterone levels. AVT immunoreactive (AVT-ir) cell numbers were counted in the anterior hypothalamus (AH), paraventricular nucleus (PN), posterior hypothalamus (PH), preoptic area (POA), and supra optic nuclei (SON). 2-way randomized block design was conducted to assess AVT-ir cell number differences between dominant and subordinate animals and Pearson's correlations were used to determine if a relationship existed between T levels and AVT-ir cell numbers. Dominant animals had more AVT-ir cells in the POA compared to subordinate animals, and subordinate animals had fewer AVT-ir cells in the POA compared to males housed either singly or with a female. There were no differences in AVT-ir cell numbers between dominant and subordinate animals in other areas. T levels were not correlated with the AVT-ir cell numbers in any area. Thus dominant animals have increased AVT-ir cell numbers compared to subordinate animals in a brain region known to be important in male sexual behavior. However, this difference is not related to differences in T.},

Here, I provide a prospectus for identifying genes underlying adaptive phenotypic traits in anoles. First I review patterns of diversification in Anolis and the important morphological axes along which divergence occurs. Then I discuss two features of anole diversification, the repeated, convergent evolution of ecomorphs, and phenotypic divergence among populations within species, that provide opportunities to identify genes underlying adaptive phenotypic variation. While small clutch size and difficulty with captive rearing currently limit the utility of quantitative trait locus analyses, comparative analyses of gene expression, and population genomic approaches are promising.},

	Abstract = {Genomic resources for studies of nonavian reptiles have recently improved and will reach a new level of access once the genomes of the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) and the green anole (Anolis carolinensis) have been published. Eleven speakers gathered for a symposium on reptilian genomics and evolutionary genetics at the 2008 meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in San Antonio, Texas. Presentations described results of reptilian genetic studies concerning molecular evolution, chromosomal evolution, genomic architecture, population dynamics, endocrinology and endocrine disruption, and the evolution of developmental mechanisms. The presented studies took advantage of the recent generation of genetic and genomic tools and resources. Novel findings demonstrated the positive impact made by the improved availability of resources like genome annotations and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). The symposium was timely and important because it provided a vehicle for the dissemination of novel findings that advance the field. Moreover, this meeting fostered the synergistic interaction of the participants as a group, which is anticipated to encourage the funding and creation of further resources such as additional BAC libraries and genomic projects. Novel data have already been collected and studies like those presented in this symposium promise to shape and improve our understanding of overall amniote evolution. Additional reptilian taxa such as the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), and garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) should be the foci of future genomic projects. We hope that the following articles in this volume will help promote these efforts by describing the conclusions and the potential that the improvement of genomic resources for nonavian reptiles can continue having in this important area of integrative and comparative biology.},

	Abstract = {Dispersal is a key component of an organism's life history and differences in dispersal between sexes appear to be widespread in vertebrates. However, most predictions of sex-biased dispersal have been based on observations of social structure in birds and mammals and more data are needed on other taxa to test whether these predictions apply in other organisms. Caribbean anole lizards are important model organisms in various biological disciplines, including evolutionary biology. However, very little is known about their dispersal strategies despite the importance of dispersal for population structure and dynamics. Here we use nine microsatellite markers to assess signatures of sex-biased dispersal on two spatial sampling scales in Anolis roquet, an anole endemic to the island of Martinique. Significantly higher gene diversity (H(S)) and lower mean assignment value (mAIC) was found in males on the larger spatial sampling scale. Significant heterozygote deficit (F(IS)), lower population differentiation (F(ST)), mAIC and variance of assignment index (vAIC) was found in males on the smaller spatial scale. The observation of male biased dispersal conform with expectations based on the polygynous mating system of Anolis roquet, and contributes to an explanation of the contrasting patterns of genetic structure between maternal and biparental markers that have been reported previously in this, and other anoline, species.},

	Abstract = {Steroids present in egg yolk have been shown to vary as a result of numerous social and environmental influences and to produce both positive and negative phenotypic outcomes in offspring. In the present study, we examined how quality of the diet affects plasma and yolk steroids in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), a lizard species with genotypic sex determination. We documented the effects of body condition on plasma testosterone (T) and corticosterone (CORT)-steroids with frequently opposing effects-in breeding females and on the T and CORT content of their eggs. We chose to manipulate body condition via diet because resource availability is a relevant, fluctuating variable in the environment to which females can be expected to respond. Field-collected females were housed in the laboratory and kept on either a reduced, standard, or enhanced diet (differing in nutritional quality and/or quantity) for ten weeks. Although females did not differ in body condition at the beginning of the study, we found these diet regimes effective in producing females that differed in condition by the end of the study. Females on diets of enhanced quality were in better condition, produced more, but not heavier, eggs, and had higher plasma T concentrations than did females on a standard diet or one of reduced quality. There was also a significant positive relationship between laying sequence of eggs and yolk T for females on diets of enhanced quality, but not for the females on diets of standard or reduced quality. There were no effects of quality of diet on CORT in plasma or yolk, but yolk T and yolk CORT exhibited a strong positive correlation irrespective of treatment. Females on diets of reduced quality did not differ from females on standard diets either with respect to reproductive output or to endocrine profiles, in spite of being in worse body condition. These results demonstrate that females' body condition, physiology, and reproductive output can be manipulated by quality of diet, and that changes in deposition of yolk steroids in response to diet may be minimal.},

If this hypothesis is correct, it follows that similar dawn and dusk choruses should occur in territorial animals exploiting other signal modalities. Adult male Anolis lizards defend territories by using elaborate head-bobbing displays and extensions of a throat fan or dewlap. Males are inactive at night and return to their territories at dawn, remaining there until dusk. I quantified the production of visual displays as a function of time of day for four species on the island of Jamaica: Anolis lineatopus, Anolis sagrei, Anolis grahami, and Anolis opalinus. All exhibited dawn and/or dusk peaks in display behavior. These patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals.},

However, Anolis also exhibits substantial species richness and ecomorphological disparity on mainland Central and South America. We compared patterns and rates of morphological evolution to investigate whether, in fact, island Anolis are exceptionally diverse relative to their mainland counterparts. Quite the contrary, we found that rates and extent of diversification were comparable--Anolis adaptive radiation is not an island phenomenon. However, mainland and Caribbean anoles occupy different parts of morphological space; in independent colonizations of both island and mainland habitats, island anoles have evolved shorter limbs and better-developed toe pads. These patterns suggest that the two areas are on different evolutionary trajectories. The ecological causes of these differences are unknown, but may relate to differences in predation or competition among mainland and island communities.},

	Abstract = {Anolis lizards have become a model system for the study of adaptive radiations as species with similar morphologies occupying similar habitats have arisen independently on all the larger islands in the Caribbean. However, on both, Cuba and Hispaniola unique forms have evolved that seemingly have no counterparts on any of the other Caribbean islands. Anoles of the genus Chamaeleolis comprise such a unique form and have been termed 'twig giants' because of their cryptic life style, slow locomotor mode, and short limbs. However, some of the most unusual features of these lizards are their large heads and molluscivorous diet. Here, we compare head shape, bite force, and muscle structure among sexes and age classes of Chamaeleolis lizards with Anolis crown giants. Our data show that Chamaeleolis lizards have a dramatically different head shape characterized by tall heads with a pronounced temporal ridge and long snouts. Analyses of bite force, surprisingly, show no differences between adult Chamaeleolis and Anolis crown giants. Juveniles of Chamaeleolis, however, have very tall heads for their size and bite harder than Anolis juveniles do. This can be related to the propensity of juveniles of this genus to eat snails, food items for which high bite forces are crucial. This observation is corroborated by the presence of well-developed jaw adductors in juveniles. Thus, our data suggest that the unusual phenotype of adults with large and tall heads may be due to selection on the juvenile life history stages.},

	Abstract = {Squamates are well-known models for studying to examine locomotor and feeding behaviors in tetrapods, but studies that integrate both behavioral activities remain scarce. Anolis lizards are a classical lineage to study the evolutionary relationships between locomotor behavior and complex structural features of the habitat. Here, we analyzed prey-capture behavior in one representative arboreal predator, Anolis carolinensis, to demonstrate the functional links between locomotor strategies and the kinematics of feeding. A. carolinensis uses two strategies to catch living insects on perches: Head-Up Capture and Jump Capture. In both cases, lizards use lingual prehension to capture the prey and the kinematic patterns of the trophic apparatus are not significantly influenced by the selected strategies. Therefore, to capture one prey type, movements of the trophic structures are highly fixed and A. carolinensis modulates the locomotor pattern to exploit the environment. Predation behavior in A. carolinensis integrates two different behavioral patterns: locomotor plasticity of prey-approach and biomechanical stereotypy of tongue prehension to successfully capture the prey.},

	Abstract = {Lizard ears are clear examples of two-input pressure-difference receivers, with up to 40-dB differences in eardrum vibration amplitude in response to ipsi- and contralateral stimulus directions. The directionality is created by acoustical coupling of the eardrums and interaction of the direct and indirect sound components on the eardrum. The ensuing pressure-difference characteristics generate the highest directionality of any similar-sized terrestrial vertebrate ear. The aim of the present study was to measure the gain of the direct and indirect sound components in three lizard species: Anolis sagrei and Basiliscus vittatus (iguanids) and Hemidactylus frenatus (gekkonid) by laser vibrometry, using either free-field sound or a headphone and coupler for stimulation. The directivity of the ear of these lizards is pronounced in the frequency range from 2 to 5 kHz. The directivity is ovoidal, asymmetrical across the midline, but largely symmetrical across the interaural axis (i.e., front-back). Occlusion of the contralateral ear abolishes the directionality. We stimulated the two eardrums with a coupler close to the eardrum to measure the gain of the sound pathways. Within the frequency range of maximal directionality, the interaural transmission gain (compared to sound arriving directly) is close to or even exceeds unity, indicating a pronounced acoustical transparency of the lizard head and resonances in the interaural cavities. Our results show that the directionality of the lizard ear is caused by the acoustic interaction of the two eardrums. The results can be largely explained by a simple acoustical model based on an electrical analog circuit.},

	Abstract = {Varied egg incubation temperatures can result in immediate effects on the phenotype of reptiles, and also latent effects that can augment or contradict effects evident at egg hatching. I examined the effects of incubation temperature on embryonic development, hatching morphology, and subsequent growth in multiple populations of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. Eggs from wild-caught females in four populations were incubated at up to three temperatures, 23.5, 27, and 30 degrees C. Measures of body size were collected immediately after hatching and weekly thereafter, while juveniles were maintained in a common laboratory environment for 8 weeks. Cooler incubation temperatures resulted in longer incubation periods but did not affect conversion of egg mass to hatchling mass. Incubation temperature did not affect hatchling mass or snout vent length (SVL), but did affect subsequent growth in both mass and SVL, which varied by population. Cooler incubation temperatures generally resulted in greater overall growth over 8 weeks of housing all juveniles in a common environment. In A. carolinensis, egg incubation temperature had latent effects on juvenile growth despite the absence of any detected immediate effects on hatchling phenotype. Therefore, the total impact and evolutionary importance of developmental environment should not be assessed or assumed based solely on the phenotype of reptiles at birth or hatching.},

@article{Beck:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Sex and seasonal differences in the brain occur in many species and are often related to behavioral expression. For example, morphology of limbic regions involved in male sex behavior are larger in males than in females, and sometimes are larger in the breeding than non-breeding season. Morphology can often be altered in adulthood by manipulating levels of steroid hormones. In untreated green anole lizards, previous work indicated that neuron soma size and density did not differ between the sexes in the preoptic area (POA) or ventromedial nucleus of the amygdala (AMY), two brain regions involved in the control of male reproductive behaviors [O'Bryant, E.L., Wade, J., 2002. Seasonal and sexual dimorphisms in the green anole forebrain. Horm. Behav. 41, 384-395.]. However, soma size was larger in both areas in breeding than non-breeding animals. The current study examined sex and seasonal differences in estimated brain region volume and total neuron number in the POA, AMY, and the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), a region typically involved in female reproductive behaviors. The volume of the POA was larger in males, and the POA and VMH of breeding animals were larger than those of non-breeding individuals. Differences in cell number did not exist in either of these two regions. In contrast, neuron counts in the AMY were greater in non-breeding than breeding animals, but the volume did not differ between the seasons. These data suggest that the structure of limbic brain regions is dynamic in adulthood and that parallels between morphology and the expression of masculine behavior exist for the POA, whereas other relationships are more complicated.},

@article{Thorpe:2008aa,
	Abstract = {The biogeographic patterns in sexually reproducing animals in island archipelagos may be interpreted as reflecting the importance of allopatric speciation. However, as the forms are allopatric, their reproductive isolation is largely untestable. A historical perspective integrating geology and molecular phylogeny reveals specific cases where ancient precursor islands coalesce, which allows the application of population genetics to critically test genetic isolation. The Anolis populations on Martinique in the Lesser Antilles are one such case where species-level populations on ancient precursor islands (ca 6-8 Myr BP) have met relatively recently. The distribution of the mtDNA lineages is tightly linked to the precursor island, but the population genetic analysis of microsatellite variation in large samples shows no evidence of restricted genetic exchange between these forms in secondary contact. This tests, and rejects, the hypothesis of simple allopatric speciation in these forms. By contrast, Martinique has pronounced environmental zonation, to which anoles are known to adapt. The population genetic analysis shows restricted genetic exchange across the ecotone between xeric coastal habitat and montane rainforest. This does not indicate full ecological speciation in these forms, but it does suggest the relative importance of the role of ecology in speciation in general.},

	Abstract = {Fever is a non-specific host defense mechanism that comprises part of the innate immune response. Innate immune function is thought to be an important adaptive immunological response to infection because it occurs across a broad diversity of phyla. Some reptiles can mount a febrile response, despite the fact that their internal body temperatures (T(b)s) are, to some extent, controlled by the environmental temperatures in which they live. This study was undertaken to determine if LPS would induce fever in green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis). Lizards were maintained in thermal gradients (22-45 degrees C) with a 12-h diurnal cycle. anoles were injected with LPS, pyrogen-free saline, or left untreated, and their T(b)s were recorded every 15min using internal cloacal probes. All lizards showed a diurnal periodicity in T(b) characterized by decreased temperatures during the scotophase (dark hours) and higher temperatures during the photophase (light phase). Anoles injected with LPS exhibited a hypothermic response, relative to untreated and saline-injected animals. The response varied from 2.1 to 4.6 degrees C lower than control lizards. The hypothermic response was initiated within 12-24h of LPS injection, and continued for 3 days after treatment. However, the anapyrexic response was observed primarily during scotophases, with photophase hypothermia observed only on the first day after LPS injection.},

	Abstract = {Molecular genetic analyses show that introduced populations undergoing biological invasions often bring together individuals from genetically disparate native-range source populations, which can elevate genotypic variation if these individuals interbreed. Differential admixture among multiple native-range sources explains mitochondrial haplotypic diversity within and differentiation among invasive populations of the lizard Anolis sagrei. Our examination of microsatellite variation supports the hypothesis that lizards from disparate native-range sources, identified using mtDNA haplotypes, form genetically admixed introduced populations. Furthermore, within-population genotypic diversity increases with the number of sources and among-population genotypic differentiation reflects disparity in their native-range sources. If adaptive genetic variation is similarly restructured, then the ability of invasive species to adapt to new conditions may be enhanced.},

@article{Beck:2008ab,
	Abstract = {In adulthood, the copulatory system in male green anole lizards is characterized by the presence of two hemipenes, each controlled by ipsilateral muscles. These structures are present in both sexes early in development, but prior to hatching regress completely in females. Embryonic treatment with steroid hormones alters the morphology of the copulatory system, suggesting active roles for both androgens and estrogens in sexual differentiation. To elucidate the timing and sites of steroid hormone action in the embryonic copulatory system, the distributions of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) mRNA expression were examined. In situ hybridization was conducted on the rostral tail of anoles at three stages spanning differentiation of the copulatory structures: embryonic days (E) 13, 18, and 24 (hatching occurs at approximately E34). At E13, males expressed significantly higher levels of AR mRNA in both hemipenes and muscles than did females, while females at the same age tended to express higher levels of ER alpha mRNA in these structures. By E18, hemipenes and copulatory muscles were regressed in most females, and were not present in any females at E24. In males, no effect of age was detected on the expression of either AR or ER alpha. These data suggest that peripheral copulatory structures in the embryonic anole are direct targets for the actions of both androgens and estrogens in sexual differentiation, consistent with the idea that estradiol facilitates regression in females and androgen promotes survival in males. However, the issue of whether or not a critical period exists remains open.},

@article{Sarkey:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Androgen receptors are expressed in many different neuronal populations in the central nervous system where they often act as transcription factors in the cell nucleus. However, recent studies have detected androgen receptor immunoreactivity in neuronal and glial processes of the adult rat neocortex, hippocampal formation, and amygdala as well as in the telencephalon of eastern fence and green anole lizards. This review discusses previously published findings on extranuclear androgen receptors, as well as new experimental results that begin to establish a possible functional role for androgen receptors in axons within cortical regions. Electron microscopic studies have revealed that androgen receptor immunoreactive processes in the rat brain correspond to axons, dendrites and glial processes. New results show that lesions of the dorsal CA1 region by local administration of ibotenic acid reduce the density of androgen receptor immunoreactive axons in the cerebral cortex and the amygdala, suggesting that these axons may originate in the hippocampus. Androgen receptor immunoreactivity in axons is also decreased by the intracerebroventricular administration of colchicine, suggesting that androgen receptor protein is transported from the perikaryon to the axons by fast axonal transport. Androgen receptors in axons located in the cerebral cortex and amygdala and originating in the hippocampus may play an important role in the rapid behavioral effects of androgens.},

@article{Calsbeek:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Males and females share most of their genetic material yet often experience very different selection pressures. Some traits that are adaptive when expressed in males may therefore be maladaptive when expressed in females. Recent studies demonstrating negative correlations in fitness between parents and their opposite-sex progeny suggest that natural selection may favor a reduction in trait correlations between the sexes to partially mitigate intralocus sexual conflict. We studied sex-specific forms of selection acting in Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles, a group for which the importance of natural selection has been well documented in species-level diversification, but for which less is known about sexual selection. Using the brown anole (Anolis sagrei), we measured fitness-related variation in morphology (body size), and variation in two traits reflecting whole animal physiological condition: running endurance and immune function. Correlations between body size and physiological traits were opposite between males and females and the form of natural selection acting on physiological traits significantly differed between the sexes. Moreover, physiological traits in progeny were correlated with the body-size of their sires, but correlations were null or even negative between parents and their opposite-sex progeny. Although results based on phenotypic and genetic correlations, as well as the action of natural selection, suggest the potential for intralocus sexual conflict, females used sire body size as a cue to sort sperm for the production of either sons or daughters. Our results suggest that intralocus sexual conflict may be at least partly resolved through post-copulatory sperm choice in A. sagrei.},

	Abstract = {PCCA (phylogenetic canonical correlation analysis) is a new program for canonical correlation analysis of multivariate, continuously valued data from biological species. Canonical correlation analysis is a technique in which derived variables are obtained from two sets of original variables whereby the correlations between corresponding derived variables are maximized. It is a very useful multivariate statistical method for the calculation and analysis of correlations between character sets. The program controls for species non-independence due to phylogenetic history and computes canonical coefficients, correlations and scores; and conducts hypothesis tests on the canonical correlations. It can also compute a multivariate version of Pagel's lambda, which can then be used in the phylogenetic transformation.

	Abstract = {The development of tetrapod digits is directed by the Homeobox (Hox) genes. The expression of Hox genes is influenced by exposure to endogenous sex steroids during development so that prenatal exposure to estrogens and androgens positively influences the lengths of digits 2 (2D) and 4 (4D), respectively. Because of this, Manning (2002) predicted that male tetrapods should have smaller 2D:4D than that of females because males are exposed to higher levels of androgens during development. We measured digits in green anolis lizards (Anolis carolinensis) to (a) test Manning's prediction; (b) compare our results with those of other studies of digit ratios in reptiles and birds to test the phylogenetic constraint hypothesis, which argues that the digit ratios of reptiles and birds should be more similar to each other than either taxa is to mammals because the patterns have been conserved in living diapsids; and (c) compare our results with those of another study of digit ratio in anoles (Chang et al., 2006). We did not detect evidence of sexual dimorphism in 2D:4D. Our results did not support either Manning's prediction or the phylogenetic constraint hypothesis. Furthermore, our results did not match those found in Chang et al. (2006), suggesting that digit ratios in anolis lizards may not be reliable indicators of prenatal exposure to hormones.},

	Abstract = {Species introductions provide a rare opportunity to study rapid evolutionary and genetic processes in natural systems, often under novel environmental pressures. Few empirical studies have been able to characterize genetic founder effects associated with demographic bottlenecks at the earliest stages of species introductions. This study utilizes prior mitochondrial DNA information which identifies the putative source population for a recently established (c. 7 years between import and sampling) species introduction. We investigated the evidence for a founder effect in a highly successful introduction of a Puerto Rican Anolis species that has established itself on Dominica to the localized exclusion of the native, endemic anole. Five highly polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to explore the partitioning of genetic diversity within and between native source, native nonsource, and introduced populations of Anolis cristatellus. Group comparisons reveal significantly lower allelic richness and expected heterozygosity in introduced populations compared to native populations; however, tests for heterozygosity excess relative to allelic richness failed to provide consistent evidence for a founder effect within introduced populations. Significant levels of within-population genetic variation were present in both native and introduced populations. We suggest that aspects of the reproductive ecology of Anolis (high fecundity, sperm storage and multiple paternity) offer an important mechanism by which genetic variation may be maintained following demographic bottlenecks and founder events in some squamate taxa.},

	Abstract = {The time associated with speciation varies dramatically among lower vertebrates. The nature and timing of divergence is investigated in the fantastic dwarf gecko Sphaerodactylus fantasticus complex, a nominal species that occurs on the central Lesser Antillean island of Guadeloupe and adjacent islands and islets. This is compared to the divergence in the sympatric anole clade from the Anolis bimaculatus group. A molecular phylogenetic analysis of numerous gecko populations from across these islands, based on three mitochondrial DNA genes, reveals several monophyletic groups occupying distinct geographical areas, these being Les Saintes, western Basse Terre plus Dominica, eastern Basse Terre, Grand Terre, and the northern and eastern islands (Montserrat, Marie Galante, Petite Terre, Desirade). Although part of the same nominal species, the molecular divergence within this species complex is extraordinarily high (27% patristic distance between the most divergent lineages) and is compatible with this group occupying the region long before the origin of the younger island arc. Tests show that several quantitative morphological traits are correlated with the phylogeny, but in general the lineages are not uniquely defined by these traits. The dwarf geckos show notably less nominal species-level adaptive radiation than that found in the sympatric southern clade of Anolis bimculatus, although both appear to have occupied the region for a broadly similar period of time. Nevertheless, the dwarf gecko populations on Les Saintes islets are the most morphologically distinct and are recognized as a full species (Sphaerodactylus phyzacinus), as are anoles on Les Saintes (Anolis terraealtae).},

@article{Rodriguez-Robles:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Species with restricted geographic distributions consisting of isolated populations are particularly susceptible to extinction because these demes face an increased risk of disappearing due to environmental, demographic, and genetic stochasticity. We used partial DNA sequences of the cytochrome b (1083 bp) and ND2 (1041 bp) mitochondrial genes to investigate the phylogeography and population genetics of Anolis cooki, a threatened lizard endemic to the southwestern coast of the Caribbean Island of Puerto Rico. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods revealed relatively shallow genetic differentiation among 27 unique haplotypes (from 52 individuals) from the known extant populations of A. cooki in mainland Puerto Rico. Despite this pattern, specimens from the same geographic area tended to nest together. The most basal division within A. cooki is between haplotypes from the three westernmost populations (Punta Aguila, Morrillos, Playa Santa) and the remainder demes (Bahia Ballena, La Cueva, Punta Verraco). The three westernmost populations of A. cooki are separated from their conspecific demes by the Guanica Bay and the Loco River drainage system, which together may represent a physiographic barrier for A. cooki. Each population of A. cooki only has private haplotypes; in other words, there are no shared mitochondrial types between populations. Because the number of private haplotypes can be used as an indirect measure of gene flow, this finding suggests that currently there is no migration among demes, and that each is an independent demographic unit, despite the relatively short distances (ca. 2 km) that separate some of them. Pairwise F(ST) values and spatial analyses of molecular variation confirmed the existence of distinct groups of genetically defined sampling areas, and of significant molecular variation among populations within groups and within populations. The conservation status of the populations of A. cooki varies greatly. The demes from Punta Aguila, Morrillos, and Bahia Ballena inhabit protected areas, and are larger, genetically diverse, and seemingly stable. The population from Playa Santa showed a high level of genetic diversity, but it occurs in an area that has been intensively developed for residential and touristic purposes, and its long-term survival is uncertain. A. cooki is also known from Caja de Muertos, an island off the southcentral coast of Puerto Rico. Surveys conducted on September 2006 and March 2007 did not produce any specimens, and a thorough assessment of Caja de Muertos is needed to determine the present status of A. cooki on the island.},

	Abstract = {1. A growing number of studies demonstrate that natural selection acts on traits important in whole animal performance and physiology. 2. Here we describe a heritable polymorphism in female dorsal pattern in the lizard Anolis sagrei (Dumeril & Bibron 1837). 3. Morphs did not differ in body size or habitat use (perch diameter), however, we show that the social environment, estimated by the number of female neighbours, had different selective effects on alternative morphs in nature. 4. We show that morphs displayed a significantly different immune response to phytohaemagglutinin. Furthermore, natural selection differentially acted on combinations of female morph and immunocompetence, favouring high levels of immune function in one morph and low levels of immune function in the other. 5. We discuss the possibility that morph-specific investments in life-history traits may lead to correlational selection between traits, even when those traits are likely to be determined by different genetic loci.},

@article{Kolbe:2007ab,
	Abstract = {Invasive species are classically thought to suffer from reduced within-population genetic variation compared to their native-range sources due to founder effects and population bottlenecks during introduction. Reduction in genetic variation in introduced species may limit population growth, increase the risk of extinction, and constrain adaptation, hindering the successful establishment and spread of an alien species. Results of recent empirical studies, however, show higher than expected genetic variation, rapid evolution, and multiple native-range sources in introduced populations, which challenge the classical scenario of invasive-species genetics. With mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data, we examined the molecular genetics of 10 replicate introductions of 8 species of Anolis lizards. Eighty percent of introductions to Florida and the Dominican Republic were from multiple native-range source populations. MtDNA haplotypes restricted to different geographically distinct populations in the native range of a species commonly occurred as intrapopulation polymorphisms in introduced populations. Two-thirds of introduced populations had two or more sources, and admixture elevated genetic variation in half of the introduced populations above levels typical of native-range populations. The mean pairwise sequence divergence among haplotypes sampled within introduced populations was nearly twice that within native-range populations (2.6% vs. 1.4%). The dynamics of introductions from multiple sources and admixture explained the observed genetic contrasts between native and introduced Anolis populations better than the classical scenario for most introduced populations. Elevated genetic variation through admixture occurred regardless of the mode or circumstances of an introduction. Little insight into the number of sources or amount of genetic variation in introduced populations was gained by knowing the number of physical introductions, the size of a species' non-native range, or whether it was a deliberate or accidental introduction. We hypothesize that elevated genetic variation through admixture of multiple sources is more common in biological invasions than previously thought. We propose that introductions follow a sequential, two-step process involving a reduction in genetic variation due to founder effects and population bottlenecks followed by an increase in genetic variation if admixture of individuals from multiple native-range sources occurs.},

@article{Calsbeek:2008ac,
	Abstract = {A central theme underlying studies of adaptive radiation is that ecologically mediated selection drives diversification. However, demonstrating the ecological basis of natural selection and linking this process to patterns of morphological diversity represents a formidable challenge. This is because selection experiments that test correlations between an organism's phenotype and its ecology are difficult to perform in the wild. Previous studies of Anolis lizards have shown that divergent morphologies are correlated with habitat use and have evolved repeatedly on islands throughout the Greater Antilles. Here, we show that the forms of selection acting within a species support an ecological mechanism for diversification. In natural populations, performance-related traits such as limb length are subject to correlational and disruptive selection driven by differences in habitat use. Experimental manipulations in the wild verify the same pattern of selection and indicate that both the targets and forms of selection are consistent through time. Elsewhere, we have demonstrated that these traits are heritable and should therefore evolve in response to selection. Our results provide evidence for the short-term repeatability of selection and its potency in the diversification of anoles.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies suggest that a nutritional/energetic state may be determined from the delta(15)N-values of an animal's tissues. It has been hypothesized that if an animal is in a negative nutritional/energetic balance, (15)N will be retained by the tissues preferentially and (14)N preferentially excreted. Over time, this should cause enrichment of the delta(15)N-values of the tissues. Tests of this hypothesis have met with mixed results. To date, these studies have focused on endotherms. Few studies have considered the effects of fasting on the (15)N/(14)N ratios of substrates from ectotherms. We hypothesized that the delta(15)N-values of tail tissue and uric acid of fasted lizards would increase over time, while that of the fed lizards would remain the same. We fasted five side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) and five green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) for 14 days. At the same time we fed six side-blotched and four green anoles ad libitum. All lizards were given water ad libitum. During this period, we collected uric acid from each lizard daily and tail tissue on the first day of the study and on the last day of the study. We found the the delta(15)N-values of uric acid of fasted lizards at the end of the study were (15)N-enriched compared with that of the control lizards in both species, probably due to a shift in amino acid source pools during fasting. However, we found no difference between treatment and controls in the delta(15)N-values of the tails.},

	Abstract = {Social interactions include a variety of stimulating but challenging factors that are the basis for strategies that allow individuals to cope with novel or familiar stressful situations. Evolutionarily conserved strategies have been identified that reflect specific behavioral and physiological identities. In this review we discuss a unique model for social stress in the lizard Anolis carolinensis, which has characteristics amenable to an investigation of individual differences in behavioral responses via central and sympathetic neurochemical adaptation. Profiles of proactive and reactive phenotypes of male A. carolinensis are relatively stable, yet retain limited flexibility that allows for the development of the social system over time. For male A. carolinensis, the celerity of social signal expression and response translate into future social standing. In addition, proactive aggressive, courtship, and feeding behaviors also predict social rank, but are not as important as prior interactions and memories of previous opponents to modify behavioral output and affect social status. The central neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, and the endocrine stress axis (HPA) appear to be the fundamental link to adaptive stress coping strategies during social interactions. Only small adaptations to these neural and endocrine systems are necessary to produce the variability measured in behavioral responses to stressful social interactions. These neuroendocrine factors are also manifest in responses to other stimuli and form the basis of heritable strategies for coping with stress.},

	Abstract = {Despite the empirical and theoretical attention paid to the role of sexual signals in resolving agonistic interactions between conspecific males, few studies have applied a comparative perspective, particularly across species that vary in combat intensity. We investigated the relative roles of a male sexual signal (dewlap size) and whole-organism performance capacity (bite force) on male combat outcomes in nine species of Caribbean Anolis lizards that differ markedly in territoriality, as indicated by sexual size dimorphism. We found that (1) dewlap size was generally an honest signal of bite force in dimorphic but not less dimorphic species; (2) maximum bite force consistently predicted male combat success in dimorphic but not less dimorphic species; (3) in contrast to a priori predictions, dewlap size significantly predicted male combat success in less dimorphic but not dimorphic species; and (4) the incidence of biting but not dewlapping increases as species become more dimorphic. These findings suggest that more dimorphic (and hence more territorial) species escalate to biting during fights more readily compared with less territorial species. The ecological and behavioral qualities of species may therefore modify both the shape and the size of sexually selected traits as well as the nature of the information those traits convey.},

	Abstract = {Natural selection is an important driver of microevolution. Yet, despite significant theoretical debate, we still have a poor understanding of how selection operates on interacting traits (i.e., morphology, performance, habitat use). Locomotor performance is often assumed to impact survival because of its key role in foraging, predator escape, and social interactions, and shows strong links with morphology and habitat use within and among species. In particular, decades of study suggest, but have not yet demonstrated, that natural selection on locomotor performance has shaped the diversification of Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles. Here, we estimate natural selection on sprinting speed and endurance in small replicate island populations of Anolis sagrei. Consistent with past correlational studies, long-limbed lizards ran faster on broad surfaces but also had increased sprint sensitivity on narrow surfaces. Moreover, performance differences were adaptive in the wild. Selection favored long-limbed lizards that were fast on broad surfaces, and preferred broad substrates in nature, and also short-limbed lizards that were less sprint sensitive on narrow surfaces, and preferred narrow perches in nature. This finding is unique in showing that selection does not act on performance alone, but rather on unique combinations of performance, morphology, and habitat use. Our results support the long-standing hypothesis that correlated selection on locomotor performance, morphology, and habitat use drives the evolution of ecomorphological correlations within Caribbean Anolis lizards, potentially providing a microevolutionary mechanism for their remarkable adaptive radiation.},

	Abstract = {Vertebrate developmental biologists typically rely on a limited number of model organisms to understand the evolutionary bases of morphological change. Unfortunately, a typical model system for squamates (lizards and snakes) has not yet been developed leaving many fundamental questions about morphological evolution unaddressed. New model systems would ideally include clades, rather than single species, that are amenable to both laboratory studies of development and field-based analyses of ecology and evolution. Combining an understanding of development with an understanding of ecology and evolution within and between closely related species has the potential to create a seamless understanding of how genetic variation underlies ecologically and evolutionarily relevant variation within populations and between species. Here we briefly introduce a new model system for the integration of development, evolution, and ecology, the lizard genus Anolis, a diverse group of lizards whose ecology and evolution is well understood, and whose genome has recently been sequenced. We present a developmental staging series for Anolis lizards that can act as a baseline for later comparative and experimental studies within this genus.},

	Abstract = {Expression of the immediate early gene, c-fos, was used to investigate changes in neuronal activity in forebrain regions involved in male sexual behavior following social, hormonal and/or seasonal manipulations in the male green anole. These factors all influence behavior, yet it is unclear how they interact to modify neuronal activity in forebrain regions, including the preoptic area (POA) and ventromedial nucleus of the amygdala (AMY). These regions are involved in the display of sexual behaviors in male green anoles as in many other vertebrates. To determine the effects of seasonal, hormonal and social cues on these brain areas, we investigated c-fos under environmental conditions typical of the breeding or non-breeding season in adult male green anoles that were castrated and implanted with either testosterone (T) or blank (Bl) capsules. We also manipulated social cues by exposing only half of the animals in each group to females. T enhanced courtship and copulatory behaviors, but decreased c-fos expression in the AMY. A similar, although not statistically significant, pattern was observed in the POA, and the density of c-fos+ cells was negatively correlated in that region with the number of extensions of a throat fan (dewlap) used during courtship. Therefore, it appears that in the male green anole, T may diminish c-fos expression (likely in inhibitory neurons) in the POA and AMY to create a permissive environment in which the appropriate behavioral response can be displayed.},

	Abstract = {The repeated, convergent evolution of body shape and microhabitat use in Greater Antillean lizards of the genus Anolis (anoles) provides compelling evidence of the importance of microhabitat specialization in shaping morphology. Interestingly, sexual dimorphism is also extensive, with males and females differing in body size as well as in shape. It is important to note that the components of shape analyzed in these studies is related to locomotion and are size-adjusted, including: relative limb and body lengths and mass of the body. Numbers of lamellae were also used and these do not vary with size. Furthermore, dimorphism in both size and shape differs by habitat type. Thus, does functionally-relevant sexual dimorphism imply that one sex is the "ecological" sex, with the other being maladapted to it's environment? Alternatively, sexual dimorphism may interact with adaptive diversification. Different classes of individuals within a species may act as separate ecological units if they play ecologically different roles. Here, I reanalyze a data set of morphological data for 15 species of Puerto Rican and Jamaican Anolis, which represent two largely independent adaptive radiations of lizards. I test for concordance between size and shape dimorphism and microhabitat (ecomorph) type, and for "parallel" patterns of sexual dimorphism among species. I integrate these results and, in the light of previous research, evaluate the relative influence that larger-scale ecological patterns have on sexual dimorphism, as well as the influence of sexual dimorphism on community structuring. I conclude that the presence of ecologically-relevant dimorphism may in fact increase the adaptive diversity present within a community.},

	Abstract = {Males and females are known to differ in a whole suite of characteristics, such as morphology, physiology, ecology, and behavior. Intersexual differences are generally believed to arise because of differences in selective pressures on either sex. In this study, we investigated whether intersexual differences in escape behavior exist in lizards of the genus Anolis, and whether these could be explained by intersexual differences in body size and/or microhabitat use. To do so, we compared the behavioral response to an approaching human predator in the field in males and females of 12 Anolis species. We found that ecomorphs and sexes differ greatly with respect to escape behavior. Twig anoles have the shortest approach distance (i.e., distance between the observer and the lizard when it starts fleeing) and final distance (i.e., distance between the observer and the lizard when it stops moving), compared with the other ecomorphs. The distance fled, on the contrary, is greatest in twig anoles. Also, females flee less soon and run over shorter distances than do males. Since twig anoles are considered the most cryptic anoles, and females may be less conspicuous than males, these results corroborate the idea that well camouflaged animals allow predators to come closer. The interspecific variation in sexual dimorphism in escape behavior, however, cannot be explained by the interspecific variation in sexual size dimorphism or sexual dimorphism in microhabitat use. Thus, escape behavior appears determined by different factors in males and females.},

	Abstract = {The evolutionary processes that result in reliable links between male signals and fighting capacity have received a great deal of attention, but the proximate mechanisms underlying such connections remain understudied. We studied a large sample of male green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) to determine whether testosterone or corticosterone predicted dewlap size and/or bite-force capacity, as dewlap size is known to be a reliable predictor of bite-force capacity in territorial males. We also examined whether these relationships were consistent between previously described body size classes ("lightweights" and "heavyweights"). Heavyweights had 50% higher testosterone concentrations than lightweights during the breeding season, suggesting a mechanism for the disproportionately larger heads and dewlaps and higher bite-forces of heavyweights. Plasma testosterone concentrations were positively correlated with dewlap size and bite-force performance in lightweights (but not heavyweights) but only because of mutual intercorrelation of all three variables with body size. We suggest two possibilities for the relationship between testosterone levels and body size: (1) testosterone promotes growth in this species or (2) smaller sexually mature males are unable to compete with larger males such that the benefits of elevated testosterone do not outweigh the costs. Corticosterone levels did not differ between the male morphs, and lightweights, but not heavyweights, showed an inverse relationship between testosterone levels and corticosterone levels. Our results suggest that testosterone is important for traits related to dominance in adult male green anoles and may influence the ability to compete with rivals via fighting ability or through the use of signals.},

	Abstract = {During agonistic interactions between male Anolis carolinensis, perception of a visual sign stimulus (darkened eyespots) not only inhibits aggression and promotes initial attainment of dominant social status, but also evokes distinct neuroendocrine responses in each opponent. This study was designed to examine the effect of eyespot manipulation on behavior and social rank during a second interaction between opponents that had previously established a natural dyadic social hierarchy. Prior to a second interaction, eyespots of familiar size-matched combatants were manipulated to reverse information conveyed by this visual signal. Eyespots on the previously dominant male were masked with green paint to indicate low aggression and social status. Previously subordinate males had their eyespots permanently marked with black paint to convey high aggression and status. Opponents were then re-paired for a second 10 min interaction following either 1 or 3 days of separation. Aggression was generally decreased and social status between pairs remained reasonably consistent. Unlike rapidly activated monoaminergic activity that occurs following the initial pairing, most brain areas sampled were not affected when animals were re-introduced, regardless of visual signal reversal or length of separation between interactions. However in males with "normal" eyespot color, dominant males had reduced serotonergic activity in CA(3) and raphe, while subordinate males exhibited elevated CA(3) dopaminergic activity. Reversing eyespot color also reversed serotonergic activity in raphe and dopaminergic activity in CA(3) after 3 days of separation. The results suggest that males remember previous opponents, and respond appropriately to their previous social rank in spite of eyespot color.},

	Abstract = {At present, molecular bases of spectral tuning in rhodopsin-like (RH2) pigments are not well understood. Here, we have constructed the RH2 pigments of nocturnal Tokay gecko (Gekko gekko) and diurnal American chameleon (Anolis carolinensis) as well as chimeras between them. The RH2 pigments of the gecko and chameleon reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal had the wavelengths of maximal absorption (lambda(max)'s) of 467 and 496 nm, respectively. Chimeric pigment analyses indicated that 76-86%, 14-24%, and 10% of the spectral difference between them could be explained by amino acid differences in transmembrane (TM) helices I-IV, V-VII, and amino acid interactions between the two segments, respectively. Evolutionary and mutagenesis analyses revealed that the lambda(max)'s of the gecko and chameleon pigments diverged from each other not only by S49A (serine to alanine replacement at residue 49), S49F (serine to phenylalanine), L52M (leucine to methionine), D83N (aspartic acid to asparagine), M86T (methionine to threonine), and T97A (threonine to alanine) but also by other amino acid replacements that cause minor lambda(max)-shifts individually.},

@article{Goodman:2007aa,
	Abstract = {The thermal environment experienced during embryonic development can profoundly affect the phenotype, and potentially the fitness, of ectothermic animals. We examined the effect of incubation temperature on the thermal preferences of juveniles in the oviparous lizard, Anolis carolinensis. Temperature preference trials were conducted in a laboratory thermal gradient within 48 hr of hatching and after 22-27 days of maintenance in a common laboratory environment. Incubation temperature had a significant effect on the upper limit of the interquartile range (IQR) of temperatures selected by A. carolinensis within the first 2 days after hatching. Between the first and second trials, the IQR of selected temperatures decreased significantly and both the lower limit of the IQR and the median selected temperature increased significantly. This, along with a significant incubation temperature by time interaction in the upper limit of the IQR, resulted in a pattern of convergence in thermoregulation among treatment groups. The initial differences in selected temperatures, as well as the shift in selected temperatures between first and second trials, demonstrate plasticity in temperature selection. As a previous study failed to find environmentally induced plasticity in temperature selection in adult A. carolinensis, this study suggests that this type of plasticity is exclusive to the period of neonatal development.},

@article{Bolnick:2007aa,
	Abstract = {There is extensive evidence that some species of ecological generalists, which use a wide diversity of resources, are in fact heterogeneous collections of relatively specialized individuals. This within-population variation, or "individual specialization," is a key requirement for frequency-dependent interactions that may drive a variety of types of evolutionary diversification and may influence the population dynamics and ecological interactions of species. Consequently, it is important to understand when individual specialization is likely to be strong or weak. The niche variation hypothesis (NVH) suggests that populations tend to become more generalized when they are released from interspecific competition. This niche expansion was proposed to arise via increased variation among individuals rather than increased individual niche breadth. Consequently, we expect ecological generalists to exhibit stronger individual specialization, but this correlation has been repeatedly rejected by empiricists. The drawback with previous empirical tests of the NVH is that they use morphological variation as a proxy for niche variation, ignoring the role of behavior and complex phenotype-function relationships. Here, we used diet data to directly estimate niche variation among individuals. Consistent with the NVH, we show that more generalized populations also exhibit more niche variation. This trend is quite general, appearing in all five case studies examined: three-spine stickleback, Eurasian perch, Anolis lizards, intertidal gastropods, and a community of neotropical frogs. Our results suggest that generalist populations may tend to be more ecologically variable. Whether this translates into greater genetic variation, evolvability, or ecological stability remains to be determined.},

@article{Neal:2007ac,
	Abstract = {Investigating individual differences in sexual performance in unmanipulated males is important for understanding natural relationships between behavior and morphology, and the mechanisms regulating them. Among male green anole lizards, some court and copulate frequently (studs) and others do not (duds). To evaluate potential factors underlying differences in the level of these behaviors, morphology and androgen receptor expression in neuromuscular courtship and copulatory structures, as well as in the preoptic area and amygdala, were compared in males displaying varying degrees of sexual function. This study revealed that individual differences in behavior among unmanipulated males, in particular the extension of a throat fan (dewlap) used during courtship, were positively correlated with the size of fibers in the associated muscle and with soma size in the amygdala. The physiological response to testosterone, as indicated by the height of cells in an androgen-sensitive portion of the kidney, was also correlated with male sexual behavior, and predicted it better than plasma androgen levels. Androgen receptor expression was not related to the display of courtship or copulation in any of the tissues examined. The present data indicate that higher levels of male courtship behavior result in (or are the result of) enhanced courtship muscle and amygdala morphology, and that androgen-sensitive tissue in studs may be more responsive to testosterone than duds. However, some mechanism(s) other than androgen receptor expression likely confer this difference in responsiveness.},

	Abstract = {New cartilaginous tissues in lizards is formed during the regeneration of the tail or after vertebral damage. In order to understand the origin of new cartilaginous cells in the embryo and after injury of adult vertebrae we have studied the distribution of proliferating cartilaginous cells in the vertebral column of embryos and adults of the lizard Anolis lineatopus using autoradiography for H3-thymidine and light and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry for 5BrdU. Proliferating sclerotomal cells initially surround the notochord in a segmental pattern and give rise to the chondrocytes of the vertebral centrum that replace the original chordal cells. Qualitative observations show that proliferating sclerotomal cells dilute the labeling up to 13 days post-injection but a few maintain the labeling as long labeling retention cells and remain in the inter-centra and perichondrium after birth. These cells supply new chondroblasts for post-natal growth of vertebrae but can also proliferate in case of vertebral damage or tail amputation in lizards, a process that sustains tail regeneration. The lack of somitic organization in the regenerating tail impedes the re-formation of a segmental vertebral column that is instead replaced by a continuous cartilaginous tube. It is hypothesized that long labeling retaining cells might represent stem/primordial cells, and that their permanence in the inter-vertebral cartilages and the nearby perichondrium in adult lizards pre-adapt these reptiles to elicit a broad cartilage regeneration in case of injury of the vertebrae.

	Abstract = {This study aimed to prepare and characterize enzymatic modified chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) with gallic acid (GA) or octyl gallate (OG) to optimize its potential in human application and to evaluate their protective role against ochrtoxin A (OTA) toxicity in catfish. The modified CSNPs have average size around 90nm with positive charge and high scavenging activity especially GA-CSNPs. In the in vivo study, catfish were divided into 8 groups and treated for 3 weeks as follow: the control group, OTA-treated group (1mg/kg b.w.), the groups treated with CSNPs, GA-CSNPs or OG-CSNPs (280mg/kg b.w.) anole or in combination with OTA. Blood, liver and kidney samples were collected for different analyses. OTA induced a significant biochemical disturbances accompanied with oxidative stress in liver and kidney, histological changes and increase DNA fragmentation in the kidney. Co-treatment with OTA plus the different CSNPs resulted in a significant improvement in all tested parameters and histological picture of the kidney. This improvement was more pronounced in the group treated with GA-CSNPs. It could be concluded that grafting of GA or its ester improved the properties of CSNPs. Moreover, GA-CSNPs showed strong scavenging properties than OG-CSNPs due to the blocking of carboxyl groups responsible of the scavenging activity in OG.},

	Abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLR) are ancient innate immune receptors crucial for immune homeostasis and protection against infection. TLRs are present in mammals, birds, amphibians and fish but have not been functionally characterized in reptiles despite the central position of this animal class in vertebrate evolution. Here we report the cloning, characterization, and function of TLR5 of the reptile Anolis carolinensis (Green Anole lizard). The receptor (acTLR5) displays the typical TLR protein architecture with 22 extracellular leucine rich repeats flanked by a N- and C-terminal leucine rich repeat domain, a membrane-spanning region, and an intracellular TIR domain. The receptor is phylogenetically most similar to TLR5 of birds and most distant to fish TLR5. Transcript analysis revealed acTLR5 expression in multiple lizard tissues. Stimulation of acTLR5 with TLR ligands demonstrated unique responsiveness towards bacterial flagellin in both reptile and human cells. Comparison of acTLR5 and human TLR5 using purified flagellins revealed differential sensitivity to Pseudomonas but not Salmonella flagellin, indicating development of species-specific flagellin recognition during the divergent evolution of mammals and reptiles. Our discovery of reptile TLR5 fills the evolutionary gap regarding TLR conservation across vertebrates and provides novel insights in functional evolution of host-microbe interactions.},

In addition, we re-sequenced the mitogenome of the closely related Eastern green lizard L. viridis using the same techniques as for L. bilineata. The mitogenomes of L. bilineata and L. viridis showed a sequence identity of 94.4% and 99.9%, respectively, relative to the previously published L. viridis mitogenome.

	Abstract = {The expression of male secondary sexual traits can be dynamic, changing size, shape, color, or structure over the course of different seasons. However, the factors underlying such changes are poorly understood. In male Anolis carolinensis lizards, a morphological secondary sexual signal called the dewlap changes size seasonally within individuals. Here, we test the hypothesis that seasonal changes in male dewlap size are driven by increased use and extension of the dewlap in spring and summer, when males are breeding, relative to the winter and fall. We captured male green anole lizards prior to the onset of breeding and constrained the dewlap in half of them such that it could not be extended. We then measured dewlap area in the spring, summer, and winter, and dewlap skin and belly skin elasticity in summer and winter. Dewlaps in unconstrained males increase in area from spring to summer and then shrink in the winter, whereas the dewlaps of constrained males consistently shrink from spring to winter. Dewlap skin is significantly more elastic than belly skin, and skin overall is more elastic in the summer relative to winter. These results show that seasonal changes in dewlap size are a function of skin elasticity and display frequency, and suggest that the mechanical properties of signaling structures can have important implications for signal evolution and design.},

	Abstract = {Reproductive phenology often varies geographically within species, driven by environmental gradients that alter growth and reproduction. However, environments can differ between adjacent habitats at single localities. In lowland Puerto Rico, both open (sunny, warm) and forested (shady, cool) habitats may be only meters apart. The lizard Anolis cristatellus lives in both habitats: it thermoregulates carefully in the open but is a thermoconformer in the forest. To determine whether reproduction differs between habitats, we compared reproductive cycles of females in open versus forest habitats at two localities for over 2 years. Open females were more likely than forest females to be reproductive throughout the year, probably because open females were able to bask and thereby achieve warmer body temperatures. These between-habitat differences in reproduction were especially marked in cool months and are equivalent in magnitude to those between populations separated by elevation. Thus, environmental differences (even on a microlandscape scale) matter to reproduction and probably to demography.},

	Abstract = {The epidermis of lizards is made of multiple alpha- and beta-layers with different characteristics comprising alpha-keratins and corneous beta-proteins (formerly beta-keratins). Three main modifications of body scales are present in the lizard Anolis carolinensis: gular scales, adhesive pad lamellae, and claws. The 40 corneous beta-proteins present in this specie comprise glycine-rich and glycine-cysteine-rich subfamilies, while the 41 alpha-keratins comprise cysteine-poor and cysteine-rich subfamilies, the latter showing homology to hair keratins. Other genes for corneous proteins are present in the epidermal differentiation complex, the locus where corneous protein genes are located. The review summarizes the main sites of immunolocalization of beta-proteins in different scales and their derivatives producing a unique map of body distribution for these structural proteins. Small glycine-rich beta-proteins participate in the formation of the mechanically resistant beta-layer of most scales. Small glycine-cysteine beta-proteins have a more varied localization in different scales and are also present in the pliable alpha-layer. In claws, cysteine-rich alpha-keratins prevail over cysteine-poor alpha-keratins and mix to glycine-cysteine-rich beta-proteins. The larger beta-proteins with a molecular mass similar to that of alpha-keratins participate in the formation of the fibrous meshwork present in differentiating beta-cells and likely interact with alpha-keratins. The diverse localization of alpha-keratins, beta-proteins, and other proteins of the epidermal differentiation complex gives rise to variably pliable, elastic, or hard corneous layers in different body scales. The corneous layers formed in the softer or harder scales, in the elastic pad lamellae, or in the resistant claws possess peculiar properties depending on the ratio of specific corneous proteins.},

	Abstract = {Tails play an important role in dynamic stabilization during falling and jumping in lizards. Yet tail autotomy (the voluntary loss of an appendage) is a common mechanism used for predator evasion in these animals. How tail autotomy has an impact on locomotor performance and stability remains poorly understood. The goal of this study was to determine how tail loss affects running kinematics and performance in the arboreal green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. Lizards were run along four surface widths (9.5 mm, 15.9 mm, 19.0 mm and flat), before and following 75% tail autotomy. Results indicate that when perturbed with changes in surface breadth and tail condition, surface breadth tends to have greater impacts on locomotor performance than tail loss. Furthermore, while tail loss does have a destabilizing effect during regular running in these lizards, its function during steady locomotion is minimal. Instead, the tail probably plays a more active role during dynamic maneuvers that require dramatic changes in whole body orientation or center of mass trajectories.},

	Abstract = {For 150 years or more, specimens were routinely collected and deposited in natural history collections without preserving fresh tissue samples for genetic analysis. In the case of most herpetological specimens (i.e. amphibians and reptiles), attempts to extract and sequence DNA from formalin-fixed, ethanol-preserved specimens-particularly for use in phylogenetic analyses-has been laborious and largely ineffective due to the highly fragmented nature of the DNA. As a result, tens of thousands of specimens in herpetological collections have not been available for sequence-based phylogenetic studies. Massively parallel High-Throughput Sequencing methods and the associated bioinformatics, however, are particularly suited to recovering meaningful genetic markers from severely degraded/fragmented DNA sequences such as DNA damaged by formalin-fixation. In this study, we compared previously published DNA extraction methods on three tissue types subsampled from formalin-fixed specimens of Anolis carolinensis, followed by sequencing. Sufficient quality DNA was recovered from liver tissue, making this technique minimally destructive to museum specimens. Sequencing was only successful for the more recently collected specimen (collected ~30 ybp). We suspect this could be due either to the conditions of preservation and/or the amount of tissue used for extraction purposes. For the successfully sequenced sample, we found a high rate of base misincorporation. After rigorous trimming, we successfully mapped 27.93% of the cleaned reads to the reference genome, were able to reconstruct the complete mitochondrial genome, and recovered an accurate phylogenetic placement for our specimen. We conclude that the amount of DNA available, which can vary depending on specimen age and preservation conditions, will determine if sequencing will be successful. The technique described here will greatly improve the value of museum collections by making many formalin-fixed specimens available for genetic analysis.},

	Abstract = {Performance measures associated with the vertebrate jaw system may provide important insights into vertebrate ecology and evolution because of their importance in many ecologically relevant tasks. Previous studies have shown that in many taxa, evolution toward higher bite force has gone hand in hand with the evolution of larger body size. However, independent of differences in overall body size, bite force may vary depending on head size and shape as well. Moreover, the underlying musculature may also drive variation in bite force. Here, we investigate the proximate determinants of bite force in lizards of the genus Anolis. We dissected the jaw muscles and quantified muscle mass, fibre length, and cross-sectional area. Data were analysed for both sexes independently given the sexual dimorphism detected in the dataset. Our results show that the traits that explain bite force are similar in both males and females with overall body size and muscle mass being the principal determinants. Among the different muscles examined, the adductor externus and the pseudotemporalis groups were the best determinants of bite force. However, models run for males predicted the variation in bite force better than models for females, suggesting that selection on morphology improving bite force may be stronger in males.},

@article{Moen:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Striking evolutionary convergence can lead to similar sets of species in different locations, such as in cichlid fishes and Anolis lizards, and suggests that evolution can be repeatable and predictable across clades. Yet, most examples of convergence involve relatively small temporal and/or spatial scales. Some authors have speculated that at larger scales (e.g., across continents), differing evolutionary histories will prevent convergence. However, few studies have compared the contrasting roles of convergence and history, and none have done so at large scales. Here we develop a two-part approach to test the scale over which convergence can occur, comparing the relative importance of convergence and history in macroevolution using phylogenetic models of adaptive evolution. We apply this approach to data from morphology, ecology, and phylogeny from 167 species of anuran amphibians (frogs) from 10 local sites across the world, spanning approximately 160 myr of evolution. Mapping ecology on the phylogeny revealed that similar microhabitat specialists (e.g., aquatic, arboreal) have evolved repeatedly across clades and regions, producing many evolutionary replicates for testing for morphological convergence. By comparing morphological optima for clades and microhabitat types (our first test), we find that convergence associated with microhabitat use dominates frog morphological evolution, producing recurrent ecomorphs that together encompass all sampled species in each community in each region. However, our second test, which examines whether and how much species differ from their inferred optima, shows that convergence is incomplete: that is, phenotypes of most species are still somewhat distant from the estimated optimum for each microhabitat, seemingly because of insufficient time for more complete adaptation (an effect of history). Yet, these effects of history are related to past ecologies, and not clade membership. Overall, our study elucidates the dominant drivers of morphological evolution across a major vertebrate clade and shows that evolution can be repeatable at much greater temporal and spatial scales than commonly thought. It also provides an analytical framework for testing other potential examples of large-scale convergence.},

	Abstract = {The amniote phallus and limbs differ dramatically in their morphologies but share patterns of signaling and gene expression in early development. Thus far, the extent to which genital and limb transcriptional networks also share cis-regulatory elements has remained unexplored. We show that many limb enhancers are retained in snake genomes, suggesting that these elements may function in non-limb tissues. Consistent with this, our analysis of cis-regulatory activity in mice and Anolis lizards reveals that patterns of enhancer activity in embryonic limbs and genitalia overlap heavily. In mice, deletion of HLEB, an enhancer of Tbx4, produces defects in hindlimbs and genitalia, establishing the importance of this limb-genital enhancer for development of these different appendages. Further analyses demonstrate that the HLEB of snakes has lost hindlimb enhancer function while retaining genital activity. Our findings identify roles for Tbx4 in genital development and highlight deep similarities in cis-regulatory activity between limbs and genitalia.},

	Abstract = {In Anolis lizards, sexual dimorphism has been reported in morphological and ecological traits. Males show larger body size and longer limbs related to territorial combat and courtship display with the dewlap. Although functional-anatomical traits are closely related to locomotor behaviors, differences between sexes in musculoskeletal traits on limbs remain unclear. We explored the relationships among sexual dimorphisms in musculoskeletal morphology, habitat, and locomotor traits in Anolis lizards. Specifically, we examined appendicular musculoskeletal morphology in three species of Cuban Anolis by measuring muscle mass and lengths of moment arms. Through comparisons of crossing locomotion, we found that the runner species possessed larger extensors in hindlimbs, which are advantageous for running, whereas the masses of the humeral and femoral retractors were larger in climber species, allowing these lizards to hold up their bodies and occupy tree substrates. Comparisons between the sexes showed different trends among the three species. Males of A. porcatus, which inhabit narrow branches or leaves, had stronger elbow extensors that maintain the display posture. In contrast, males of A. sagrei, which occupy broad surfaces, did not show sexual differences that affected social display. Moreover, A. bartschi indicated sexual differences despite the absence of dewlapping behavior. Our findings suggest that both sexes show fundamentally similar relationships between muscular morphology and locomotor habits to adapt arboreal or terrestrial substrates, and yet sexual dimorphism in forelimb muscles may additionally affected by male specific display with the dewlap.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The lizards of the family Agamidae are one of the most prominent elements of the Australian reptile fauna. Here, we present a genomic resource built on the basis of a wild-caught male ZZ central bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps. FINDINGS: The genomic sequence for P. vitticeps, generated on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, comprised 317 Gbp (179X raw read depth) from 13 insert libraries ranging from 250 bp to 40 kbp. After filtering for low-quality and duplicated reads, 146 Gbp of data (83X) was available for assembly. Exceptionally high levels of heterozygosity (0.85 % of single nucleotide polymorphisms plus sequence insertions or deletions) complicated assembly; nevertheless, 96.4 % of reads mapped back to the assembled scaffolds, indicating that the assembly included most of the sequenced genome. Length of the assembly was 1.8 Gbp in 545,310 scaffolds (69,852 longer than 300 bp), the longest being 14.68 Mbp. N50 was 2.29 Mbp. Genes were annotated on the basis of de novo prediction, similarity to the green anole Anolis carolinensis, Gallus gallus and Homo sapiens proteins, and P. vitticeps transcriptome sequence assemblies, to yield 19,406 protein-coding genes in the assembly, 63 % of which had intact open reading frames. Our assembly captured 99 % (246 of 248) of core CEGMA genes, with 93 % (231) being complete. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the P. vitticeps assembly is comparable or superior to that of other published squamate genomes, and the annotated P. vitticeps genome can be accessed through a genome browser available at https://genomics.canberra.edu.au.},

@article{Gasse:2015aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In a recent study, we have demonstrated that amelotin (AMTN) gene structure and its expression during amelogenesis have changed during tetrapod evolution. Indeed, this gene is expressed throughout enamel matrix deposition and maturation in non-mammalian tetrapods, while in mammals its expression is restricted to the transition and maturation stages of amelogenesis. Previous studies of amelogenin (AMEL) gene expression in a lizard and a salamander have shown similar expression pattern to that in mammals, but to our knowledge there are no data regarding ameloblastin (AMBN) and enamelin (ENAM) expression in non-mammalian tetrapods. The present study aims to look at, and compare, the structure and expression of four enamel matrix protein genes, AMEL, AMBN, ENAM and AMTN during amelogenesis in the lizard Anolis carolinensis. RESULTS: We provide the full-length cDNA sequence of A. carolinensis AMEL and AMBN, and show for the first time the expression of ENAM and AMBN in a non-mammalian species. During amelogenesis in A. carolinensis, AMEL, AMBN and ENAM expression in ameloblasts is similar to that described in mammals. It is noteworthy that AMEL and AMBN expression is also found in odontoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that AMTN is the only enamel matrix protein gene that is differentially expressed in ameloblasts between mammals and sauropsids. Changes in AMTN structure and expression could be the key to explain the structural differences between mammalian and reptilian enamel, i.e. prismatic versus non-prismatic.},

	Abstract = {The Cerrado is a wide Neotropical savanna with tremendously high endemic diversity. Yet, it is not clear what the prevalent processes leading to such diversification are. We used the Cerrado-endemic lizard Norops meridionalis to investigate the main abiotic factors that promoted genetic divergence, the timings of these divergence events, and how these relate to cryptic diversity in the group. We sequenced mitochondrial and nuclear genes from 21 sites of N. meridionalis to generate species tree, divergence time estimations, and estimate species limits. We also performed population-level analysis and estimated distribution models to test the roles of niche conservatism and divergence in the group diversification. We found that N. meridionalis is composed by at least five cryptic species. Divergence time estimations suggest that the deepest branches split back into the early-mid Miocene, when most of the geophysical activity of the Cerrado took place. The deep divergences found in N. meridionalis suggest that beta anoles invaded South America much earlier than previously thought. Recent published evidence supports this view, indicating that the Panama gap closed as early as 15mya, allowing for an early invasion of Norops into South America. The spatial pattern of diversification within N. meridionalis follows a northwest-southeast direction, which is consistent across several species of vertebrates endemic to the Cerrado. Also, we found evidence for non-stationary isolation by distance, which occurs when genetic differentiation depends on space. Our preliminary data in two out of five lineages suggest that niche conservatism is an important mechanism that promoted geographic fragmentation in the group.},

	Abstract = {When foraging, animals can maximize their fitness if they are able to tailor their foraging decisions to current environmental conditions. When making foraging decisions, individuals need to assess the benefits of foraging while accounting for the potential risks of being captured by a predator. However, whether and how different factors interact to shape these decisions is not yet well understood, especially in individual foragers. Here we present a standardized set of manipulative field experiments in the form of foraging assays in the tropical lizard Anolis cristatellus in Puerto Rico. We presented male lizards with foraging opportunities to test how the presence of conspecifics, predation-risk perception, the abundance of food, and interactions among these factors determines the outcome of foraging decisions. In Experiment 1, anoles foraged faster when food was scarce and other conspecifics were present near the feeding tray, while they took longer to feed when food was abundant and when no conspecifics were present. These results suggest that foraging decisions in anoles are the result of a complex process in which individuals assess predation risk by using information from conspecific individuals while taking into account food abundance. In Experiment 2, a simulated increase in predation risk (i.e., distance to the feeding tray) confirmed the relevance of risk perception by showing that the use of available perches is strongly correlated with the latency to feed. We found Puerto Rican crested anoles integrate instantaneous ecological information about food abundance, conspecific activity and predation risk, and adjust their foraging behavior accordingly.},

	Abstract = {Green anoles are seasonally breeding lizards in which male sexual behavior is primarily regulated by an annual increase in testosterone. This hormone activates stereotyped behaviors, as well as morphological and biochemical changes in the brain, with greater effect in the breeding season than in the non-breeding season. This study is the first description of CREB binding protein (CBP) in the reptilian brain, and investigates the possibility that changes in CBP, an androgen receptor coactivator, may facilitate differences in responsiveness to testosterone across seasons. A portion of this gene was cloned for the green anole, and in situ hybridization was performed to examine the expression of CBP in the brains of gonadally intact male and female green anoles across breeding states. Additionally, hormonal regulation of CBP was evaluated across sex and season in animals that were gonadectomized and treated with testosterone or a control. Similar to other vertebrates, CBP was expressed at relatively high levels in steroid-sensitive brain regions. In the anole ventromedial amygdala, CBP mRNA levels were nearly twice as high in gonadally intact females compared to males. In contrast, CBP expression did not differ across seasons or hormone manipulation in this brain region. No significant effects were detected in the preoptic area or ventromedial hypothalamus. This pattern suggests that CBP might influence female-biased functions controlled by the ventromedial amygdala, but is not consistent with a role in mediating seasonal differences in responsiveness to testosterone in these areas associated with reproductive function.},

	Abstract = {The tradeoff between reproduction and survival is central to life-history theory and is thought to reflect underlying energetic tradeoffs between reproduction and self-maintenance. Immune responses to parasites and pathogens are important components of self-maintenance in many species, but whether these defenses impose significant energetic costs has only been tested in a handful of organisms. We tested for a metabolic cost of mounting an immune response in the male brown anole (Anolis sagrei), a lizard in which we have previously shown that reproduction causes a marked reduction in immune response to the novel antigen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). We treated captive male anoles with a subcutaneous injection of either PHA, which induces an immune response that manifests as localized swelling, or saline vehicle as a control. Prior to injection and at 24, 48, and 72 hr post-injection, we measured swelling at the site of injection and whole-animal resting metabolic rate (RMR) using stop-flow respirometry. Although we detected a robust swelling response to PHA at 24, 48, and 72 hr post-injection, mean RMR did not differ between treatments at any of these time points. However, within the PHA treatment group, RMR increased with the extent of swelling, suggesting a variable metabolic cost that scales with the magnitude of the induced immune response. Although individual anoles varied considerably in the extent to which they responded to PHA challenge, our results suggest that an immune response can impose a substantial metabolic cost (potentially as much as 63% above baseline RMR) for individuals that do respond maximally.

	Abstract = {Intralocus sexual conflict arises when selection favours alternative fitness optima in males and females. Unresolved conflict can create negative between-sex genetic correlations for fitness, such that high-fitness parents produce high-fitness progeny of their same sex, but low-fitness progeny of the opposite sex. This cost of sexual conflict could be mitigated if high-fitness parents bias sex allocation to produce more offspring of their same sex. Previous studies of the brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) show that viability selection on body size is sexually antagonistic, favouring large males and smaller females. However, sexual conflict over body size may be partially mitigated by adaptive sex allocation: large males sire more sons than daughters, whereas small males sire more daughters than sons. We explored the evolutionary implications of these phenomena by assessing the additive genetic (co)variance of fitness within and between sexes in a wild population. We measured two components of fitness: viability of adults over the breeding season, and the number of their progeny that survived to sexual maturity, which includes components of parental reproductive success and offspring viability (RS(V) ). Viability of parents was not correlated with adult viability of their sons or daughters. RS(V) was positively correlated between sires and their offspring, but not between dams and their offspring. Neither component of fitness was significantly heritable, and neither exhibited negative between-sex genetic correlations that would indicate unresolved sexual conflict. Rather, our results are more consistent with predictions regarding adaptive sex allocation in that, as the number of sons produced by a sire increased, the adult viability of his male progeny increased.},

	Abstract = {In lizards, the role of gravid oviparous females in controlling the temperature experienced by developing embryos prior to oviposition has been rarely examined. In particular, relatively little is known about the effect of gravidity on the thermal ecology of female Anolis lizards. Here we examine the thermal ecology of Anolis nebulosus from Nayarit, Mexico, with a particular goal of comparing the thermal ecology of gravid females to that of non-gravid females and males. The thermal efficiency (E) of gravid female A. nebulosus (E=0.782) was higher than in males (E=0.464), and to a lesser extent, non-gravid females (E=0.637), despite no significant differences observed in body, air, operative, or set point temperatures among males, gravid females, and non-gravid females. Gravid females had smaller differences between body temperatures and set point temperatures (db), but did not differ in the difference between operative temperature and set point temperature (de). Gravid females used sun-shade and shaded microhabitats proportionately more than males and non-gravid females, and rarely used sunny microhabitats. Our results suggest that gravid A. nebulosus are using a different and more efficient thermoregulatory strategy than other adults in the population. Such efficient thermoregulation is possibly related to females attempting to provide a thermal environment that is conducive to the development of embryos in eggs prior to oviposition.},

	Abstract = {Although the phenomenon of adhesion in geckos has been intensively studied for over 200 years, our understanding of how the morphological apparatus associated with this arose is less clear. Indeed, whether or not all of the intricate morphological hierarchy that is implicated in the attachment and removal of the adhesive setae originated at the same time is unknown. To explore whether setae may have arisen prior to the other parts of this structural hierarchy, we undertook morphological observations of Gonatodes, an ancestrally padless, sphaerodatyline genus known to exhibit the expression of incipient subdigital pads in some species. Focusing on this geographically and morphologically well-circumscribed genus, for which intraspecific relationships are adequately known and ecology is quite well documented, allowed us to deduce trends in digit proportions, shape, scalation, and skeletal structure, and associate these with the micro-ornamentation of the subdigital surfaces. Our findings indicate that in Gonatodes, setae capable of inducing adhesion are present without the modifications of the digital musculotendinous, circulatory and skeletal systems that are generally considered to be necessary for the operation of a functional adhesive apparatus. The acquisition of these latter characteristics (independently in many lineages of gekkotans, and incipiently so in Anolis) may have been preceded by a suite of modifications of the digits that enhanced static clinging in relation to sit-and-wait predation and the ability to take refuge on surfaces unavailable to other taxa. These possibilities await further testing.},

	Abstract = {The Hokou gecko (Gekko hokouensis: Gekkonidae, Gekkota, Squamata) has the chromosome number 2n = 38, with no microchromosomes. For molecular cytogenetic characterization of the gekkotan karyotype, we constructed a cytogenetic map for G. hokouensis, which retains the ancestral karyotype of Gekkota, with 86 functional genes, and compared it with cytogenetic maps for four Toxicofera species that have many microchromosomes (Elaphe quadrivirgata, Varanus salvator macromaculatus, Leiolepis reevesii rubritaeniata, and Anolis carolinensis) and that for a lacertid species (Lacerta agilis) with only one pair of autosomal microchromosomes. Ten pairs of G. hokouensis chromosomes [GHO1, 2, 3, Z(4), 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, and 15] showed highly conserved linkage homology with macrochromosomes and/or macrochromosome arms of the four Toxicofera species and corresponded to eight L. agilis macrochromosomes (LAG). However, GHO5, GHO9, GHO10, GHO11, and LAG6 were composed of chromosome segments that have a homology with Toxicofera microchromosomes, and no homology was found in the chromosomes between G. hokouensis and L. agilis. These results suggest that repeated fusions of microchromosomes may have occurred independently in each lineage of Gekkota and Lacertidae, leading to the disappearance of microchromosomes and appearance of small-sized macrochromosomes.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of large corneous beta-proteins of 18-43 kDa (Ac37, 39, and 40) in the epidermis of the lizard Anolis carolinensis is unknown. This study analyses the localization of these beta-proteins in different body scales during regeneration. Western blot analysis indicates most protein bands at 40-50 kDa suggesting they mix with alpha-keratin of intermediate filament keratin proteins. Ac37 is present in mature alpha-layers of most scales and in beta-cells of the outer scale surface in some scales but is absent in the Oberhautchen, in the setae and beta-layer of adhesive pads and in mesos cells. In differentiating beta-keratinocytes Ac37 is present over 3-4 nm thick filaments located around the amorphous beta-packets and in alpha-cells, but is scarce in precorneous and corneous layers of the claw. Ac37 forms long filaments and, therefore, resembles alpha-keratins to which it probably associates. Ac39 is seen in the beta-layer of tail and digital scales, in beta-cells of regenerating scales but not in the Oberhautchen (and adhesive setae) or in beta- and alpha-layers of the other scales. Ac40 is present in the mature beta-layer of most scales and dewlap, in differentiating beta-cells of regenerating scales, but is absent in all the other epidermal layers. The large beta-proteins are accumulated among forming beta-packets of beta-cells and are packed in the beta-corneous material of mature beta-layer. Together alpha-keratins, large beta-proteins form the denser areas of mature beta-layer that may have a different consistence that the electron-paler areas.},

	Abstract = {Whether the structure of ecological communities can exhibit stability over macroevolutionary timescales has long been debated. The similarity of independently evolved Anolis lizard communities on environmentally similar Greater Antillean islands supports the notion that community evolution is deterministic. However, a dearth of Caribbean Anolis fossils--only three have been described to date--has precluded direct investigation of the stability of anole communities through time. Here we report on an additional 17 fossil anoles in Dominican amber dating to 15-20 My before the present. Using data collected primarily by X-ray microcomputed tomography (X-ray micro-CT), we demonstrate that the main elements of Hispaniolan anole ecomorphological diversity were in place in the Miocene. Phylogenetic analysis yields results consistent with the hypothesis that the ecomorphs that evolved in the Miocene are members of the same ecomorph clades extant today. The primary axes of ecomorphological diversity in the Hispaniolan anole fauna appear to have changed little between the Miocene and the present, providing evidence for the stability of ecological communities over macroevolutionary timescales.},

	Abstract = {How well an organism completes an ecologically relevant task - its performance - is often considered a key factor in determining individual fitness. Historically, ecomorphological studies have examined how morphological traits determine individual performance in a static manner, assuming that differential fitness in a population is due indirectly to differences in morphological traits that determine a simple measure of performance. This assumption, however, ignores many ecological factors that can constrain performance in nature, such as substrate variation and individual behavior. We examined some of these complexities in the morphology-performance-fitness paradigm, primarily the impact that substrate variation has on performance. We measured maximal sprint speed of green anole lizards on four substrates that varied in size and complexity and are used by or available to individuals in nature. Performance decreased significantly from a broad substrate to a narrow substrate, and lizards were three times slower on a complex substrate than the broadest substrate. We also detected trade-offs in running on substrates with different diameters and in cluttered versus uncluttered environments. Furthermore, morphological predictors of performance varied among substrates. This indicates that natural selection may act on different morphological traits, depending on which substrates are used by individuals, as well as an individual's ability to cope with changes in substrate rather than maximal capacities.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Caribbean anole lizards (Dactyloidae) have frequently been used as models to study questions regarding biogeography and adaptive radiations, but the evolutionary history of Central American anoles (particularly those of the genus Norops) has not been well studied. Previous work has hypothesized a north-to-south dispersal pattern of Central American Norops, but no studies have examined dispersal within any Norops lineages. Here we test two major hypotheses for the dispersal of the N. humilis/quaggulus complex (defined herein, forming a subset within Savage and Guyer's N. humilis group). RESULTS: Specimens of the N. humilis group were collected in Central America, from eastern Mexico to the Canal Zone of Panama. Major nodes were dated for comparison to the geologic history of Central America, and ancestral ranges were estimated for the N. humilis/quaggulus complex to test hypothesized dispersal patterns. These lineages displayed a northward dispersal pattern. We also demonstrate that the N. humilis/quaggulus complex consists of a series of highly differentiated mitochondrial lineages, with more conserved nuclear evolution. The paraphyly of the N. humilis species group is confirmed. A spatial analysis of molecular variance suggests that current populations are genetically distinct from one another, with limited mitochondrial gene flow occurring among sites. CONCLUSIONS: The observed south-to-north colonization route within the Norops humilis/quaggulus complex represents the first evidence of a Norops lineage colonizing in a south-to-north pattern, (opposite to the previously held hypothesis for mainland Norops). One previously described taxon (N. quaggulus) was nested within N. humilis, demonstrating the paraphyly of this species; while our analyses also reject the monophyly of the Norops humilis species group (sensu Savage and Guyer), with N. tropidonotus, N. uniformis, and N. marsupialis being distantly related to/highly divergent from the N. humilis/quaggulus complex. Our work sheds light on mainland anole biogeography and past dispersal events, providing a pattern to test against other groups of mainland anoles.},

	Abstract = {Globins are small heme proteins that play an important role in oxygen supply, but may also have other functions. Globins offer a unique opportunity to study the functional evolution of genes and proteins. We have characterized the globin repertoire of two different turtle species: the Chinese softshell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) and the western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii). In the genomes of both species, we have identified eight distinct globin types: hemoglobin (Hb), myoglobin, neuroglobin, cytoglobin, globin E, globin X, globin Y, and androglobin. Therefore, along with the coelacanth, turtles are so far the only known vertebrates with a full globin repertoire. This fact allows for the first time a comparative analysis of the expression of all eight globins in a single species. Phylogenetic analysis showed an early divergence of neuroglobin and globin X before the radiation of vertebrates. Among the other globins, cytoglobin diverged first, and there is a close relationship between myoglobin and globin E; the position of globin Y is not resolved. The globin E gene was selectively lost in the green anole, and the genes coding for globin X and globin Y were deleted in chicken. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments revealed that myoglobin, neuroglobin, and globin E are highly expressed with tissue-specific patterns, which are in line with their roles in the oxidative metabolism of the striated muscles, the brain, and the retina, respectively. Histochemical analyses showed high levels of globin E in the pigment epithelium of the eye. Globin E probably has a myoglobin-like role in transporting O2 across the pigment epithelium to supply in the metabolically highly active retina.},

	Abstract = {Irisin, a novel myokine encoded by fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 gene (FNDC5), is reported to stimulate brown fat-like development of white fat tissue and thermogenesis in mammals recently. However, information about the structure, tissue expression, and roles of FNDC5/irisin remains unknown in non-mammalian vertebrates including birds. In this study, we first cloned the FNDC5 (cFNDC5) cDNA from chickens. cFNDC5 is predicted to encode a 220-amino acid precursor containing the putative 'irisin peptide' of 112 amino acids, which shows high amino acid sequence identity with irisin of humans (97%), mice (97%), anole lizards (93%) and zebrafish (~80%). Using quantitative real-time PCR, we further examined cFNDC5 mRNA expression in chicken tissues. The results showed that in adult chickens, cFNDC5 is abundantly expressed in the muscle, heart, pituitary, ovary and various brain regions, and moderately expressed in adipose tissue, kidneys, lung, testes and small intestine. Moreover, cFNDC5 is also abundantly expressed in the muscle, brain, hypothalamus and pituitary of developing embryos and post-hatching chicks. Interestingly, we noted that cFNDC5 expression in the muscle of 3-week-old chicks could be induced by fasting and cold exposure, while its expression decreases during differentiation of pre-adipocytes cultured in vitro. Collectively, our data suggest that FNDC5/irisin is more than a 'myokine' and may be related to the development/functions of many tissues (e.g. muscle, brain, fat), as well as metabolic status of chickens.},

	Abstract = {Many insects repel predators with caustic chemicals, while insects mimicking odors of wastes/dead insects to fool predators have not been documented. We found that the shore earwig, Labidura riparia (Dermaptera: Labiduridae) when bitten by anole lizards, Anolis carolinenesus, spits a rotting-flesh odor that deceives these insectivores into rejecting prey. Once a lizard attacked and rejected an earwig, the lizard did not attack another earwig during several weeks despite consuming other prey, indicating associative learning after one trial. The fetid odor was found in the head-prothorax containing salivary glands of both male and female earwigs and was comprised of approximately 100 ng dimethyl disulfide and approximately 600 ng dimethyl trisulfide. Nymphs had <5 ng of either compound. Adults also spit odorous sulfides after prolonged attacks by harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex rugosus, who were only deterred by the earwig's forceps. Sulfides released by the earwig are similar to odors of carrion/feces, which may be innately repulsive to some vertebrate predators. The mean initial discharge percentage (IDP) of sulfides from a cohort of earwigs was 62 %; however, IDPs of individuals were highly variable (3-99 %; mean 57 %). The discharge refill time (DRT) to refill 50 % of the earwig's allomone reservoir was estimated at 13 h. A positive relationship in sulfide amounts with body weight was found only in females in 2009, suggesting metabolic cost tradeoffs were revealed when sulfide content was half that in 2010. This is the first report of insects releasing sulfur-containing compounds that may mimic carrion-fecal odors as a deceptive defense against vertebrate predators.},

	Abstract = {The divergent evolution of niche-related traits can facilitate adaptive radiation, yet identification of the genetic or molecular mechanisms underlying such trait changes remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Conducting a detailed morphological comparison along growth trajectories is a powerful method for observing the formation of differences in niche-related traits. Here, we focused on hindlimb length of Anolis lizards, differences in which are related to adaptation for use of different microhabitats. We measured the length of hindlimb skeletons in different ecomorphs of anole lizards (A. sagrei, a trunk-ground ecomorph with long hindlimbs, and A. angusticeps, a twig ecomorph with short hindlimbs) from early embryonic stages to adulthood, to determine which hindlimb elements mainly differentiate the species and the timing of the formation of these differences. With respect to the digit, differences between the species mainly occurred during the embryonic stages of interdigit reduction, when the cartilage of the distal phalanges was simultaneously forming. In addition, we compared the relative length of developing autopods in early embryonic stages using whole-mount in situ hybridization before the formation of the cartilaginous bones, and the results showed that the relative growth rate of the Hoxa11-negative distal region in A. sagrei was greater than that in A. angusticeps. Our results show that there are several important developmental stages for hindlimb length differentiation between A. angusticeps and A. sagrei, depending on which hindlimb element is considered. In particular, the species differences were largely due to variations in digit length, which arose at early embryonic stages.},

	Abstract = {Retinal progenitors in the circumferential marginal zone (CMZ) and Muller glia-derived progenitors have been well described for the eyes of fish, amphibians, and birds. However, there is no information regarding a CMZ and the nature of retinal glia in species phylogenetically bridging amphibians and birds. The purpose of this study was to examine the retinal glia and investigate whether a CMZ is present in the eyes of reptilian species. We used immunohistochemical analyses to study retinal glia, neurons that could influence CMZ progenitors, the retinal margin, and the nonpigmented epithelium of ciliary body of garter snakes, queen snakes, anole lizards, snapping turtles, and painted turtles. We compare our observations on reptile eyes to the CMZ and glia of fish, amphibians, and birds. In all species, Sox9, Pax6, and the glucocorticoid receptor are expressed by Muller glia and cells at the retinal margin. However, proliferating cells were found only in the CMZ of turtles and not in the eyes of anoles and snakes. Similar to eyes of chickens, the retinal margin in turtles contains accumulations of GLP1/glucagonergic neurites. We find that filamentous proteins, vimentin and GFAP, are expressed by Muller glia, but have different patterns of subcellular localization in the different species of reptiles. We provide evidence that the reptile retina may contain nonastrocytic inner retinal glial cells, similar to those described in the avian retina. We conclude that the retinal glia, glucagonergic neurons, and CMZ of turtles appear to be most similar to those of fish, amphibians, and birds. J. Comp. Neurol. 524:74-89, 2016.

	Abstract = {Herpetofaunal declines have been documented globally, and southern Florida, USA, is an especially vulnerable region because of high impacts from hydrological perturbations and nonindigenous species. To assess the extent of recent change in herpetofauna community composition, we established a baseline inventory during 1995-97 at a managed preserve in a habitat rich area of southwest Florida, and repeated our sampling methods fifteen years later (2010-11). Nine drift fence arrays were placed in four habitat types: mesic flatwood, mesic hammock, depression marsh, and wet prairie. Trapping occurred daily for one week during 7-8 sampling runs in each period (57 and 49 total sampling days, respectively). Species richness was maintained in mesic hammock habitats but varied in the others. Catch rates of several native species (Anaxyrus terrestris, Lithobates grylio, Anolis carolinensis, Nerodia fasciata) declined significantly. Other native species (Lithobates sphenocephalus, Siren lacertian, and Notophthalmus viridescens piaropicola) that were abundant in 1995-97 declined by greater than 50%. Catch rate of only two species (the nonindigenous Anolis sagrei and the native Diadophis punctatus) increased significantly. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated similarity within habitat types but significant dissimilarity between sampling periods, confirming shifts in community composition. Analysis of individual species' contributions to overall similarity across habitats shows a shift from dominance of native species in the 1990s to increased importance of nonindigenous species in 2010-11. Although natural population fluctuations may have influenced differences between the two sampling periods, our results suggest considerable recent change in the structure and composition of this southwest Florida herpetofaunal community. The causes are unknown, but hydrological shifts and ecological impacts of nonindigenous species may have contributed.},

@article{Yuasa:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a Trp-degrading enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the kynurenine pathway. Two IDO genes, IDO1 and IDO2, are found in vertebrates and the timing of the gene duplication giving rise to the genes has been controversial. In the present study, we report that several fishes and two turtles also have both IDO1 and IDO2. This represents definitive evidence for the gene duplication occurring before the divergence of vertebrates, with IDO1 having been lost in a number of lower vertebrate lineages. IDO2 enzymes have a relatively low affinity for l-Trp; however, Anolis carolinensis (lizard) IDO2 has an affinity for l-Trp comparable to mammalian IDO1 enzymes. We identified a Ser residue located in the distal heme pocket of IDO1 (distal-Ser) (corresponding to Ser167 of human IDO1) that is conserved in all IDO1 enzymes and the lizard IDO2. This residue is conserved as Thr (distal-Thr) in other IDO2 enzymes. Biochemical analyses, using IDO variants with either Ser or Thr substitutions, suggest that the distal-Ser change was crucial for the improvement in affinity for l-Trp in ancient IDO1. The ancestral IDO1 likely had a 'moderate' enzymatic efficiency for l-Trp, clearly higher than IDO2 but lower than mammalian IDO1. The distal-Ser of lizard IDO2 bestows a high affinity for l-Trp, however, this unique IDO2 has a low enzymatic efficiency because of its very low catalytic velocity. Thus, low efficiency IDO2 enzymes have been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, whereas higher efficiency IDO1 enzymes are dispensable in many lower vertebrate lineages.},

	Abstract = {CD1, as the third family of antigen-presenting molecules, is previously only found in mammals and chickens, which suggests that the chicken and mammalian CD1 shared a common ancestral gene emerging at least 310 million years ago. Here, we describe CD1 genes in the green anole lizard and Crocodylia, demonstrating that CD1 is ubiquitous in mammals, birds, and reptiles. Although the reptilian CD1 protein structures are predicted to be similar to human CD1d and chicken CD1.1, CD1 isotypes are not found to be orthologous between mammals, birds, and reptiles according to phylogenetic analyses, suggesting an independent diversification of CD1 isotypes during the speciation of mammals, birds, and reptiles. In the green anole lizard, although the single CD1 locus and MHC I gene are located on the same chromosome, there is an approximately 10-Mb-long sequence in between, and interestingly, several genes flanking the CD1 locus belong to the MHC paralogous region on human chromosome 19. The CD1 genes in Crocodylia are located in two loci, respectively linked to the MHC region and MHC paralogous region (corresponding to the MHC paralogous region on chromosome 19). These results provide new insights for studying the origin and evolution of CD1.},

	Abstract = {Thermal activity constraints play a major role in many aspects of ectotherm ecology, including vulnerability to climate change. Therefore, there is strong interest in developing general models of the temperature dependence of activity. Several models have been put forth (explicitly or implicitly) to describe such constraints; nonetheless, tests of the predictive abilities of these models are lacking. In addition, most models consider activity as a threshold trait instead of considering continuous changes in the vigor of activity among individuals. Using field data for a tropical lizard (Anolis cristatellus) and simulations parameterized by our observations, we determine how well various threshold and continuous-activity models match observed activity patterns. No models accurately predicted activity under all of the thermal conditions that we considered. In addition, simulations showed that the performance of threshold models decreased as temperatures increased, which is a troubling finding given the threat of global climate change. We also find that activity rates are more sensitive to temperature than are the physiological traits often used as a proxy for fitness. We present a model of thermal constraint on activity that integrates aspects of both the threshold model and the continuous-activity model, the general features of which are supported by activity data from other species. Overall, our results demonstrate that greater attention should be given to fine-scale patterns of thermal constraint on activity.},

	Abstract = {The distichus species group includes six species and 21 subspecies of trunk ecomorph anoles distributed across Hispaniola and its satellite islands as well as the northern Bahamas. Although this group has long served as a model system for studies of reproductive character displacement, adaptation, behavior and speciation, it has never been the subject of a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. Our goal here is to generate a multilocus phylogenetic dataset (one mitochondrial and seven nuclear loci) and to use this dataset to infer phylogenetic relationships among the majority of the taxa assigned to the distichus species group. We use these phylogenetic trees to address three topics about the group's evolution. First, we consider longstanding taxonomic controversies about the status of several species and subspecies assigned to the distichus species group. Second, we investigate the biogeographic history of the group and specifically test the hypotheses that historical division of Hispaniola into two paleo-islands contributed to the group's diversification and that Bahamian and Hispaniolan satellite island populations are derived from colonists from the main Hispaniolan landmass. Finally, third, we use comparative phylogenetic analyses to test the hypothesis that divergence between pale yellow and darkly pigmented orange or red dewlap coloration has occurred repeatedly across the distichus species group.},

@article{Burrows:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Flightless animals have evolved diverse mechanisms to control their movements in air, whether falling with gravity or propelling against it. Many insects jump as a primary mode of locomotion and must therefore precisely control the large torques generated during takeoff. For example, to minimize spin (angular momentum of the body) at takeoff, plant-sucking bugs apply large equal and opposite torques from two propulsive legs [1]. Interacting gear wheels have evolved in some to give precise synchronization of these legs [2, 3]. Once airborne, as a result of either jumping or falling, further adjustments may be needed to control trajectory and orient the body for landing. Tails are used by geckos to control pitch [4, 5] and by Anolis lizards to alter direction [6, 7]. When falling, cats rotate their body [8], while aphids [9] and ants [10, 11] manipulate wind resistance against their legs and thorax. Falling is always downward, but targeted jumping must achieve many possible desired trajectories. We show that when making targeted jumps, juvenile wingless mantises first rotated their abdomen about the thorax to adjust the center of mass and thus regulate spin at takeoff. Once airborne, they then smoothly and sequentially transferred angular momentum in four stages between the jointed abdomen, the two raptorial front legs, and the two propulsive hind legs to produce a controlled jump with a precise landing. Experimentally impairing abdominal movements reduced the overall rotation so that the mantis either failed to grasp the target or crashed into it head first.},

	Abstract = {Previous molecular studies indicated that antimicrobial peptides in lizard are expressed in the skin and tongue among other epithelial organs. The present ultrastructural immunogold study aimed to detect the specific location of three broadly expressed antimicrobial peptides in the tongue of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. The immunocytochemical study indicated that beta-defensin-15, the likely main defensin of granulocytes and skin, is poorly expressed in some dense and medium-dense granules of glandular cells of the papillated tongue. Conversely beta-defensin-27 appears highly expressed in numerous pale and cribriform dense granules of glandular cells and is also secreted on the tongue surface. The immunostaining for cathelicidin-1 indicated a variable but however positive immunolabeling in numerous granules in the tongue glands, suggesting that this antimicrobial peptide previously found on the epidermal surface is also present in the tongue secretions and participates to the formation of the anti-microbial oral barrier. The study suggests that among the numerous beta-defensins and cathelicidins identified in the genome of this lizard is present a specific distribution of different peptide subtypes in various body regions, including the tongue, and that these peptides contribute to the formation of local antimicrobial barriers.},

@article{Bergevin:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are faint sounds generated by healthy inner ears that provide a window into the study of auditory mechanics. All vertebrate classes exhibit OAEs to varying degrees, yet the biophysical origins are still not well understood. Here, we analyzed both spontaneous (SOAE) and stimulus-frequency (SFOAE) otoacoustic emissions from a bird (barn owl, Tyto alba) and a lizard (green anole, Anolis carolinensis). These species possess highly disparate macromorphologies of the inner ear relative to each other and to mammals, thereby allowing for novel insights into the biomechanical mechanisms underlying OAE generation. All ears exhibited robust OAE activity, and our chief observation was that SFOAE phase accumulation between adjacent SOAE peak frequencies clustered about an integral number of cycles. Being highly similar to published results from human ears, we argue that these data indicate a common underlying generator mechanism of OAEs across all vertebrates, despite the absence of morphological features thought essential to mammalian cochlear mechanics. We suggest that otoacoustic emissions originate from phase coherence in a system of coupled oscillators, which is consistent with the notion of "coherent reflection" but does not explicitly require a mammalian-type traveling wave. Furthermore, comparison between SFOAE delays and auditory nerve fiber responses for the barn owl strengthens the notion that most OAE delay can be attributed to tuning.},

	Abstract = {Numerous corneous proteins are produced during the differentiation of the complex lizard epidermis, comprising hard beta-layers and softer alpha-layers. In the present ultrastructural and immunocytochemical study, we have localized a homolog of the mammalian skin barrier protein loricrin in the skin of the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). We used an antibody specific to the carboxyterminus of loricrin 1, a gene of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) of A. carolinensis. Lizard loricrin is present in the maturing alpha-layer (lacunar cells) of normal scale epidermis and in the accumulating corneocytes of the wound epidermis (lacunar cells) of the regenerating epidermis. The protein appears as a component of the alpha-layer but not of the beta-layer. Lizard loricrin is diffused in the cytoplasm of pre-corneous alpha-keratinocytes but eventually concentrates in the packing corneous material of the maturing corneocytes of the alpha-layer (lacunar) in normal epidermis or in the wound epidermis of regenerating epidermis. The protein likely contributes to the composition and pliability of the corneous material but is not specifically accumulated on the corneous cell envelope (marginal layer) that is scarcely differentiated in these cells. The study contributes to the knowledge on the distribution of specific corneous proteins that give rise to the different material properties of alpha-layers versus beta-layers in lizard epidermis.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, enormous effort and investment has been put into assembling the tree of life: a phylogenetic history for all species on Earth. Overwhelmingly, this progress toward building an ever increasingly complete phylogeny of living things has been accomplished through sophisticated analysis of molecular data. In the modern genomic age, molecular genetic data have become very easy and inexpensive to obtain for many species. However, some lineages are poorly represented in or absent from tissue collections, or are unavailable for molecular analysis for other reasons such as restrictive biological sample export laws. Other species went extinct recently and are only available in formalin museum preparations or perhaps even as subfossils. In this brief communication we present a new method for placing cryptic, recently extinct, or hypothesized taxa into an ultrametric phylogeny of extant taxa using continuous character data. This method is based on a relatively simple modification of an established maximum likelihood (ML) method for phylogeny inference from continuous traits. We show that the method works well on simulated trees and data. We then apply it to the case of placing the Culebra Island Giant Anole (Anolis roosevelti) into a phylogeny of Caribbean anoles. Anolis roosevelti is a "crown-giant" ecomorph anole hypothesized to have once been found throughout the Spanish, United States, and British Virgin Islands, but that has not been encountered or collected since the 1930s. Although this species is widely thought to be closely related to the Puerto Rican giant anole, A. cuvieri, our ML method actually places A. roosevelti in a different part of the tree and closely related to a clade of morphologically similar species. We are unable, however, to reject a phylogenetic position for A. roosevelti that places it as sister taxon to A. cuvieri; although close relationship with the remainder of Puerto Rican anole species is strongly rejected by our method.},

	Abstract = {Climate change threatens biodiversity worldwide, however predicting how particular species will respond is difficult because climate varies spatially, complex factors regulate population abundance, and species vary in their susceptibility to climate change. Studies need to incorporate these factors with long-term data in order to link climate change to population abundance. We used 40 years of lizard abundance data and local climate data from Barro Colorado Island to ask how climate, total lizard abundance and cohort-specific abundance have changed over time, and how total and cohort-specific abundance relate to climate variables including those predicted to make the species vulnerable to climate change (i.e. temperatures exceeding preferred body temperature). We documented a decrease in lizard abundance over the last 40 years, and changes in the local climate. Population growth rate was related to the previous years' southern oscillation index; increasing following cooler-wetter, la nina years, decreasing following warmer-drier, el nino years. Within-year recruitment was negatively related to rainfall and minimum temperature. This study simultaneously identified climatic factors driving long-term population fluctuations and climate variables influencing short-term annual recruitment, both of which may be contributing to the population decline and influence the population's future persistence.},

	Abstract = {DNA analysis can reveal the origins and dispersal patterns of invasive species. The green anole Anolis carolinensis is one such alien animal, which has been dispersed widely by humans from its native North America to many Pacific Ocean islands. In the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, this anole was recorded from Chichi-jima at the end of the 1960s, and then from Haha-jima in the early 1980s. These two islands are inhabited. In 2013, it was also found on the uninhabited Ani-jima, close to Chichi-jima. Humans are thought to have introduced the anole to Haha-jima, while the mode of introduction to Ani-jima is unknown. To clarify its dispersal patterns within and among these three islands, we assessed the fine-scale population genetic structure using five microsatellite loci. The results show a homogeneous genetic structure within islands, but different genetic structures among islands, suggesting that limited gene flow occurs between islands. The recently established Ani-jima population may have originated from several individuals simultaneously, or by repeated immigration from Chichi-jima. We must consider frequent incursions among these islands to control these invasive lizard populations and prevent their negative impact on native biodiversity.},

@article{Thorpe:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Global warming will impact species in a number of ways, and it is important to know the extent to which natural populations can adapt to anthropogenic climate change by natural selection. Parallel microevolution within separate species can demonstrate natural selection, but several studies of homoplasy have not yet revealed examples of widespread parallel evolution in a generic radiation. Taking into account primary phylogeographic divisions, we investigate numerous quantitative traits (size, shape, scalation, colour pattern and hue) in anole radiations from the mountainous Lesser Antillean islands. Adaptation to climatic differences can lead to very pronounced differences between spatially close populations with all studied traits showing some evidence of parallel evolution. Traits from shape, scalation, pattern and hue (particularly the latter) show widespread evolutionary parallels within these species in response to altitudinal climate variation greater than extreme anthropogenic climate change predicted for 2080. This gives strong evidence of the ability to adapt to climate variation by natural selection throughout this radiation. As anoles can evolve very rapidly, it suggests anthropogenic climate change is likely to be less of a conservation threat than other factors, such as habitat loss and invasive species, in this, Lesser Antillean, biodiversity hot spot.},

	Abstract = {Exercise training is well known to affect a suite of physiological and performance traits in mammals, but effects of training in other vertebrate tetrapod groups have been inconsistent. We examined performance and physiological differences among green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) that were trained for sprinting or endurance, using an increasingly rigorous training regimen over 8 weeks. Lizards trained for endurance had significantly higher post-training endurance capacity compared with the other treatment groups, but groups did not show post-training differences in sprint speed. Although acclimation to the laboratory environment and training explain some of our results, mechanistic explanations for these results correspond with the observed performance differences. After training, endurance-trained lizards had higher haematocrit and larger fast glycolytic muscle fibres. Despite no detectable change in maximal performance of sprint-trained lizards, we detected that they had significantly larger slow oxidative muscle fibre areas compared with the other treatments. Treatment groups did not differ in the proportion of number of fibre types, nor in the mass of most limb muscles or the heart. Our results offer some caveats for investigators conducting training research on non-model organisms and they reveal that muscle plasticity in response to training may be widespread phylogenetically.},

	Abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as a novel class of noncoding RNAs and potent gene regulators, which play an important and varied role in cellular functions. lncRNAs are closely related with the occurrence and development of some diseases. High-throughput RNA-sequencing techniques combined with de novo assembly have identified a large number of novel transcripts. The discovery of large and 'hidden' transcriptomes urgently requires the development of effective computational methods that can rapidly distinguish between coding and long noncoding RNAs. In this study, we developed a powerful predictor (named as lncRNA-MFDL) to identify lncRNAs by fusing multiple features of the open reading frame, k-mer, the secondary structure and the most-like coding domain sequence and using deep learning classification algorithms. Using the same human training dataset and a 10-fold cross validation test, lncRNA-MFDL can achieve 97.1% prediction accuracy which is 5.7, 3.7, and 3.4% higher than that of CPC, CNCI and lncRNA-FMFSVM predictors, respectively. Compared with CPC and CNCI predictors in other species (e.g., anole lizard, zebrafish, chicken, gorilla, macaque, mouse, lamprey, orangutan, xenopus and C. elegans) testing datasets, the new lncRNA-MFDL predictor is also much more effective and robust. These results show that lncRNA-MFDL is a powerful tool for identifying lncRNAs. The lncRNA-MFDL software package is freely available at for academic users.},

@article{Kerver:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Green anole lizards are seasonal breeders, with male sexual behaviour primarily regulated by an annual increase in testosterone. Morphological, biochemical and behavioural changes associated with reproduction are activated by testosterone, generally with a greater effect in the breeding season (BS) than in the nonbreeding season (NBS). The present study investigates the possibility that differences in a steroid receptor coactivator may regulate this seasonal difference in responsiveness to testosterone. In situ hybridisation was used to examine the expression of steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) in the brains of gonadally intact male and female green anoles across breeding states. A second experiment examined gonadectomised animals with and without testosterone treatment. Gonadally intact males had more SRC-1 expressing cells in the preoptic area and larger volumes of this region as defined by these cells than females. Main effects of both sex and season (males > females and BS > NBS) were present in cell number and volume of the ventromedial hypothalamus. An interaction between sex and season suggested that high expression in BS males was driving these effects. In hormone-manipulated animals, testosterone treatment increased both the number of SRC-1 expressing cells in and volumes of the preoptic area and amygdala. These results suggest that testosterone selectively regulates SRC-1, and that this coactivator may play a role in facilitating reproductive behaviours across both sexes. However, changes in SRC-1 expression are not likely responsible for the seasonal change in responsiveness to testosterone.},

@article{Meiri:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Although fecundity selection is ubiquitous, in an overwhelming majority of animal lineages, small species produce smaller number of offspring per clutch. In this context, egg, hatchling and neonate sizes are absolutely larger, but smaller relative to adult body size in larger species. The evolutionary causes of this widespread phenomenon are not fully explored. The negative offspring size allometry can result from processes limiting maximal egg/offspring size forcing larger species to produce relatively smaller offspring ('upper limit'), or from a limit on minimal egg/offspring size forcing smaller species to produce relatively larger offspring ('lower limit'). Several reptile lineages have invariant clutch sizes, where females always lay either one or two eggs per clutch. These lineages offer an interesting perspective on the general evolutionary forces driving negative offspring size allometry, because an important selective factor, fecundity selection in a single clutch, is eliminated here. Under the upper limit hypotheses, large offspring should be selected against in lineages with invariant clutch sizes as well, and these lineages should therefore exhibit the same, or shallower, offspring size allometry as lineages with variable clutch size. On the other hand, the lower limit hypotheses would allow lineages with invariant clutch sizes to have steeper offspring size allometries. Using an extensive data set on the hatchling and female sizes of > 1800 species of squamates, we document that negative offspring size allometry is widespread in lizards and snakes with variable clutch sizes and that some lineages with invariant clutch sizes have unusually steep offspring size allometries. These findings suggest that the negative offspring size allometry is driven by a constraint on minimal offspring size, which scales with a negative allometry.},

	Abstract = {Understanding community assembly and population dynamics frequently requires detailed knowledge of food web structure. For many consumers, obtaining precise information about diet composition has traditionally required sacrificing animals or other highly invasive procedures, generating tension between maintaining intact study populations and knowing what they eat. We developed 16S mitochondrial DNA sequencing methods to identify arthropods in the diets of generalist vertebrate predators without requiring a blocking primer. We demonstrate the utility of these methods for a common Caribbean lizard that has been intensively studied in the context of small island food webs: Anolis sagrei (a semi-arboreal 'trunk-ground' anole ecomorph). Novel PCR primers were identified in silico and tested in vitro. Illumina sequencing successfully characterized the arthropod component of 168 faecal DNA samples collected during three field trips spanning 12 months, revealing 217 molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) from at least nine arthropod orders (including Araneae, Blattodea, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera). Three mOTUs (one beetle, one cockroach and one ant) were particularly frequent, occurring in >/=50% of samples, but the majority of mOTUs were infrequent (180, or 83%, occurred in </=5% of samples). Species accumulation curves showed that dietary richness and composition were similar between size-dimorphic sexes; however, female lizards had greater per-sample dietary richness than males. Overall diet composition (but not richness) was significantly different across seasons, and we found more pronounced interindividual variation in December than in May. These methods will be generally useful in characterizing the diets of diverse insectivorous vertebrates.},

@article{Figuet:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Mammalian and avian genomes are characterized by a substantial spatial heterogeneity of GC-content, which is often interpreted as reflecting the effect of local GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC), a meiotic repair bias that favors G and C over A and T alleles in high-recombining genomic regions. Surprisingly, the first fully sequenced nonavian sauropsid (i.e., reptile), the green anole Anolis carolinensis, revealed a highly homogeneous genomic GC-content landscape, suggesting the possibility that gBGC might not be at work in this lineage. Here, we analyze GC-content evolution at third-codon positions (GC3) in 44 vertebrates species, including eight newly sequenced transcriptomes, with a specific focus on nonavian sauropsids. We report that reptiles, including the green anole, have a genome-wide distribution of GC3 similar to that of mammals and birds, and we infer a strong GC3-heterogeneity to be already present in the tetrapod ancestor. We further show that the dynamic of coding sequence GC-content is largely governed by karyotypic features in vertebrates, notably in the green anole, in agreement with the gBGC hypothesis. The discrepancy between third-codon positions and noncoding DNA regarding GC-content dynamics in the green anole could not be explained by the activity of transposable elements or selection on codon usage. This analysis highlights the unique value of third-codon positions as an insertion/deletion-free marker of nucleotide substitution biases that ultimately affect the evolution of proteins.},

	Abstract = {Sexual behavior in male green anole lizards is regulated by a seasonal increase in testosterone (T). However, T is much more effective at activating behavioral, morphological and biochemical changes related to reproduction in the breeding season (BS; spring) compared to nonbreeding season (NBS; fall). An increase in androgen receptor (AR) during the BS is one potential mechanism for this differential responsiveness. AR expression has not been investigated in specific brain regions across seasons in anoles. The present studies were designed to determine relative AR expression in areas important for male (preoptic area, ventromedial amygdala) and female (ventromedial hypothalamus) sexual behavior, as well as whether T upregulates AR in the anole brain. In situ hybridization and Western blot analyses were performed in unmanipulated animals across sex and season, as well as in gonadectomized animals with and without T treatment. Among hormone-manipulated animals, more cells expressing AR mRNA were detected in females than males in the amygdala. T treatment increased the volume of the ventromedial hypothalamus of gonadectomized animals in the BS, but not the NBS. AR protein in dissections of the hypothalamus and preoptic area was increased in males compared to females specifically in the BS. Additionally, among females, it was increased in the NBS compared to the BS. Collectively, these results indicate that differences in central AR expression probably do not facilitate a seasonal responsiveness to T. However, they are consistent with a role for AR in regulating some differences between sexes in the display of reproductive behaviors.},

	Abstract = {The ecology and evolution of Caribbean anoles are well described, yet little is known about mainland anole species. Lack of phylogenetic information limits our knowledge about species boundaries, morphological evolution, and the biogeography of anoles in South America. To help fill this gap, we provide an updated molecular phylogeny of the Dactyloa (Dactyloidae), with emphasis on the punctata species group. By sampling understudied Amazonian taxa, we (i) assess the phylogenetic placement of the 'odd anole', D. dissimilis; (ii) infer the relationships of the proboscis-bearing D. phyllorhina, testing the hypothesis of independent nasal appendage evolution within the anole radiation; and (iii) examine genetic and dewlap color variation in D. punctata and D. philopunctata. Combining multiple nuclear loci with a review of the fossil record, we also (iv) estimate divergence times within the pleurodont iguanian clade of lizards, including Amazonian representatives of Dactyloa and Norops (Dactyloidae) and of Polychrus (Polychrotidae). We recover the five Dactyloa clades previously referred to as the aequatorialis, heteroderma, latifrons, punctata and roquet species groups, as well as a sixth clade composed of D. dissimilis and the non-Amazonian D. neblinina and D. calimae. We find D. phyllorhina to be nested within the punctata group, suggesting independent evolution of the anole proboscis. We consistently recover D. philopunctata nested within D. punctata, and report limited genetic divergence between distinct dewlap phenotypes. The most recent common ancestor of Dactyloa, Anolis and Norops dates back to the Eocene. Most Amazonian taxa within both Dactyloa and Norops diverged in the Miocene, but some diversification events were as old as the late Eocene and late Oligocene. Amazonian Polychrus diverged in the Pliocene. Our findings have broad implications for anole biogeography, disputing recent suggestions that modern dactyloid genera were present in the Caribbean region during the Cretaceous.},

Here, using a range of phylogenomic approaches, we established the complete-definitive MuRF family of vertebrates. Adding to recognized MuRF1, 2 and 3, we describe a novel family member, hereafter MuRF4, which was independently lost during placental mammal and bird evolution, but is otherwise conserved. MuRF4 transcripts were expressed in heart and skeletal muscles of zebrafish, but were barely detectable in striated muscles of adult anole lizards. We also demonstrate that MuRF1 underwent retrotransposition in the teleost fish ancestor, before the retrogene fully replaced the original gene and muscle-specific function.},

	Abstract = {High elevation adaptation offers an excellent study system to understand the genetic basis of adaptive evolution. We acquired transcriptome sequences of two closely related lizards, Phrynocephalus przewalskii from low elevations and P. vlangalii from high elevations. Within a phylogenetic framework, we compared their genomic data along with green anole, chicken and Chinese softshell turtle, and identified candidate genes and functional categories that are potentially linked to adaptation to high elevation environments. More than 100 million sequence reads were generated for each species via Illumina sequencing. A de novo assembly produced 70,919 and 62,118 transcripts for P. przewalskii and P. vlangalii, respectively. Based on a well-established reptile phylogeny, we detected 143 positively selected genes (PSGs) along the P. vlangalii lineage from the 7,012 putative orthologs using a branch-site model. Furthermore, ten GO categories and one KEGG pathway that are over-represented by PSGs were recognized. In addition, 58 GO categories were revealed to have elevated evolutionary rates along the P. vlangalii lineage relative to P. przewalskii. These functional analyses further filter out PSGs that are most likely involved in the adaptation process to high elevations. Among them, ADAM17, MD, and HSP90B1 likely contributed to response to hypoxia, and POLK likely contributed to DNA repair. Many other candidate genes involved in gene expression and metabolism were also identified. Genome-wide scan for candidate genes may serve as the first step to explore the genetic basis of high elevation adaptation. Detailed comparative study and functional verification are needed to solidify any conclusions. High elevation adaptation requires coordinated changes in multiple genes that involve various physiological and biochemical pathways; we hope that our genetic studies will provide useful directions for future physiological or molecular studies in reptiles as well as other poikilothermic species.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, biologists have increasingly recognized that evolutionary change can occur rapidly when natural selection is strong; thus, real-time studies of evolution can be used to test classic evolutionary hypotheses directly. One such hypothesis is that negative interactions between closely related species can drive phenotypic divergence. Such divergence is thought to be ubiquitous, though well-documented cases are surprisingly rare. On small islands in Florida, we found that the lizard Anolis carolinensis moved to higher perches following invasion by Anolis sagrei and, in response, adaptively evolved larger toepads after only 20 generations. These results illustrate that interspecific interactions between closely related species can drive evolutionary change on observable time scales.},

@article{Munoz:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Bergmann's rule-the tendency for body size to increase in colder environments-remains controversial today, despite 150 years of research. Considerable debate has revolved around whether the rule applies within or among species. However, this debate has generally not considered that clade-level relationships are caused by both intra- and interspecific effects. In this article, we implement a novel approach that allows for the separation of intra- and interspecific components of trait-environment relationships. We apply this approach to body size clines in two Caribbean clades of Anolis lizards and discover that their similar body size gradients are constructed in very different ways. We find inverse Bergmann's clines-high-elevation lizards are smaller bodied-for both the cybotes clade on Hispaniola and the sagrei clade on Cuba. However, on Hispaniola, the inverse cline is driven by interspecific differences, whereas intraspecific variation is responsible for the inverse cline on Cuba. Our results suggest that similar body size clines can be constructed through differing evolutionary and ecological processes, namely, through local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity (intraspecific clines) and/or size-ordered spatial sorting (interspecific clines). We propose that our approach can help integrate a divided research program by focusing on how the combined effects of intra- and interspecific processes can enhance or erode clade-level relationships at large biogeographic scales.},

	Abstract = {Vertebrate ectotherms such as reptiles provide ideal organisms for the study of adaptation to environmental thermal change. Comparative genomic and exomic studies can recover markers that diverge between warm and cold adapted lineages, but the genes that are functionally related to thermal adaptation may be difficult to identify. We here used a bioinformatics genome-mining approach to predict and identify functions for suitable candidate markers for thermal adaptation in the chicken. We first established a framework of candidate functions for such markers, and then compiled the literature on genes known to adapt to the thermal environment in different lineages of vertebrates. We then identified them in the genomes of human, chicken, and the lizard Anolis carolinensis, and established a functional genetic interaction network in the chicken. Surprisingly, markers initially identified from diverse lineages of vertebrates such as human and fish were all in close functional relationship with each other and more associated than expected by chance. This indicates that the general genetic functional network for thermoregulation and/or thermal adaptation to the environment might be regulated via similar evolutionarily conserved pathways in different vertebrate lineages. We were able to identify seven functions that were statistically overrepresented in this network, corresponding to four of our originally predicted functions plus three unpredicted functions. We describe this network as multimodal: central regulator genes with the function of relaying thermal signal (1), affect genes with different cellular functions, namely (2) lipoprotein metabolism, (3) membrane channels, (4) stress response, (5) response to oxidative stress, (6) muscle contraction and relaxation, and (7) vasodilation, vasoconstriction and regulation of blood pressure. This network constitutes a novel resource for the study of thermal adaptation in the closely related nonavian reptiles and other vertebrate ectotherms.},

	Abstract = {Ant-nest beetles (Paussus) are the quintessential Trojan horses of the insect world. They hack the complex communication system of ants, allowing them to blend into the ant society and be treated as royalty, all the while preying upon the ants and the ants' brood and duping the ants into rearing their young. Here we present results of the first molecular-based phylogeny of ant-nest beetles, which reveals that this symbiosis has produced one of the most stunning examples of rapid adaptive radiation documented to date. The most recent ancestor of a Paussus clade endemic to Madagascar is only 2.6 million years old. This species gave rise to a remarkably phenotypically diverse clade of 86 extant species with a net diversification interval of 0.38-0.81 million years, a rate of radiation faster than classic textbook examples of large, recent, rapid radiations such as Anolis lizards on Caribbean islands, cichlids of the East African Great Lakes, finches on the Galapagos Islands, and Drosophila and tetragnathid spiders on the Hawaiian Islands. In order for Paussus to adapt to a new host ant species, the beetle's ability to perceive, deceive, and communicate with the new host must evolve quickly and in synchrony in both the larval and adult life stages, resulting in unusually strong selective pressure levied by their host ants. Data on host associations suggest that the history of host shifts may help explain both the striking phenotypic diversity within the Malagasy radiation and the evolution of phenotypically similar yet distantly related species in Madagascar and Africa.},

Based on our analyses of morphological and molecular genetic data, we recognize 21 species, six of which we describe as new (i.e., Anolis carlliebi sp. nov., A. immaculogularis sp. nov., A. nietoi sp. nov., A. sacamecatensis sp. nov., A. stevepoei sp. nov., and A. zapotecorum sp. nov.). Furthermore, we synonymize Anolis forbesi Smith & Van Gelder 1955 with Anolis microlepidotus Davis 1954. Of the recognized species, six have smooth ventral scales (i.e., Anolis dunni, A. gadovii, A. liogaster, A. omiltemanus, A. peucephilus, and A. taylori) and 14 have keeled ventral scales (i.e., A. boulengerianus, A. carlliebi, A. immaculogularis, A. megapholidotus, A. microlepidotus, A. nebuloides, A. nebulosus, A. nietoi, A. quercorum, A. sacamecatensis, A. stevepoei, A. subocularis, A. unilobatus, and A. zapotecorum). In one species, A. macrinii, the ventral scales vary from smooth to weakly keeled. For each species we provide color descriptions in life, color photographs in life, descriptions and illustration of hemipenis morphology (if available), description of external morphology, distribution maps based on the specimensexamined, comments on the conservation status, and natural history notes. Finally, we provide a dichotomous key for the identification of the 21 species of anoles occurring along the Pacific versant of Mexico west of the Isthmus de Tehuantepec in the states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Puebla.},

	Abstract = {For centuries, biogeographers have examined the factors that produce patterns of biodiversity across regions. The study of islands has proved particularly fruitful and has led to the theory that geographic area and isolation influence species colonization, extinction and speciation such that larger islands have more species and isolated islands have fewer species (that is, positive species-area and negative species-isolation relationships). However, experimental tests of this theory have been limited, owing to the difficulty in experimental manipulation of islands at the scales at which speciation and long-distance colonization are relevant. Here we have used the human-aided transport of exotic anole lizards among Caribbean islands as such a test at an appropriate scale. In accord with theory, as anole colonizations have increased, islands impoverished in native species have gained the most exotic species, the past influence of speciation on island biogeography has been obscured, and the species-area relationship has strengthened while the species-isolation relationship has weakened. Moreover, anole biogeography increasingly reflects anthropogenic rather than geographic processes. Unlike the island biogeography of the past that was determined by geographic area and isolation, in the Anthropocene--an epoch proposed for the present time interval--island biogeography is dominated by the economic isolation of human populations.},

@article{Logan:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Tropical ectotherms are thought to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they are adapted to relatively stable temperature regimes, such that even small increases in environmental temperature may lead to large decreases in physiological performance. One way in which tropical organisms may mitigate the detrimental effects of warming is through evolutionary change in thermal physiology. The speed and magnitude of this response depend, in part, on the strength of climate-driven selection. However, many ectotherms use behavioral adjustments to maintain preferred body temperatures in the face of environmental variation. These behaviors may shelter individuals from natural selection, preventing evolutionary adaptation to changing conditions. Here, we mimic the effects of climate change by experimentally transplanting a population of Anolis sagrei lizards to a novel thermal environment. Transplanted lizards experienced warmer and more thermally variable conditions, which resulted in strong directional selection on thermal performance traits. These same traits were not under selection in a reference population studied in a less thermally stressful environment. Our results indicate that climate change can exert strong natural selection on tropical ectotherms, despite their ability to thermoregulate behaviorally. To the extent that thermal performance traits are heritable, populations may be capable of rapid adaptation to anthropogenic warming.},

	Abstract = {Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) is a neuropeptide inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion, which was first identified in the Japanese quail hypothalamus. GnIH peptides share a C-terminal LPXRFamide (X=L or Q) motif in most vertebrates. The receptor for GnIH (GnIHR) is the seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor 147 (GPR147) that inhibits cAMP production. GPR147 is also named neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor 1 (NPFFR1), because it also binds NPFF that has a C-terminal PQRFamide motif. To understand the evolutionary history of the GnIH system in the animal kingdom, we searched for receptors structurally similar to GnIHR in the genome of six mammals (human, mouse, rat, cattle, cat, and rabbit), five birds (pigeon, chicken, turkey, budgerigar, and zebra finch), one reptile (green anole), one amphibian (Western clawed flog), six fishes (zebrafish, Nile tilapia, Fugu, coelacanth, spotted gar, and lamprey), one hemichordate (acorn worm), one echinoderm (purple sea urchin), one mollusk (California sea hare), seven insects (pea aphid, African malaria mosquito, honey bee, buff-tailed bumblebee, fruit fly, jewel wasp, and red flour beetle), one cnidarian (hydra), and constructed phylogenetic trees by neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. A multiple sequence alignment of the receptors showed highly conserved seven-transmembrane domains as well as disulfide bridge sites between the first and second extracellular loops, including the receptor of hydra. Both NJ and ML analyses grouped the receptors of vertebrates into NPFFR1 and NPFFR2 (GPR74), and the receptors of insects into the receptor for SIFamide peptides that share a C-terminal YRKPPFNGSIFamide motif. Although human, quail and zebrafish GnIHR (NPFFR1) were most structurally similar to SIFamide receptor of fruit fly in the Famide peptide (FMRFamide, neuropeptide F, short neuropeptide F, drosulfakinin, myosuppressin, SIFamide) receptor families, the amino acid sequences and the peptide coding regions of GnIH precursors were most similar to FMRFamide precursor of fruit fly in the precursors of Famide peptide families. Chromosome synteny analysis of the precursor genes of human, quail and zebrafish GnIH and fruit fly Famide peptides further identified conserved synteny in vertebrate GnIH and fruit fly FMRFa precursor genes as well as other Famide peptide precursor genes. These results suggest that GnIH and its receptor pair and SIFamide and its receptor pair may have diverged and co-evolved independently in vertebrates and insects, respectively, from their ancestral Famide peptide and its receptor pair, during diversification and evolution of deuterostomian and protostomian species.},

	Abstract = {The green anole, Anolis carolinensis (ACA), is the model reptile for a vast array of biological disciplines. It was the first nonavian reptile to have its genome fully sequenced. During the genome project, the XX/XY system of sex chromosomes homologous to chicken chromosome 15 (GGA15) was revealed, and 106 X-linked genes were identified. We selected 38 genes located on eight scaffolds in ACA and having orthologs located on GGA15, then tested their linkage to ACA X chromosome by using comparative quantitative fluorescent real-time polymerase chain reaction applied to male and female genomic DNA. All tested genes appeared to be X-specific and not present on the Y chromosome. Assuming that all genes located on these scaffolds should be localized to the ACA X chromosome, we more than doubled the number of known X-linked genes in ACA, from 106 to 250. While demonstrating that the gene content of chromosome X in ACA and GGA15 is largely conserved, we nevertheless showed that numerous interchromosomal rearrangements had occurred since the splitting of the chicken and anole evolutionary lineages. The presence of many ACA X-specific genes localized to distinct contigs indicates that the ACA Y chromosome should be highly degenerated, having lost a large amount of its original gene content during evolution. The identification of novel genes linked to the X chromosome and absent on the Y chromosome in the model lizard species contributes to ongoing research as to the evolution of sex determination in reptiles and provides important information for future comparative and functional genomics.},

@article{Strasser:2014aa,
	Abstract = {The evolution of amniotes has involved major molecular innovations in the epidermis. In particular, distinct structural proteins that undergo covalent cross-linking during cornification of keratinocytes facilitate the formation of mechanically resilient superficial cell layers and help to limit water loss to the environment. Special modes of cornification generate amniote-specific skin appendages such as claws, feathers, and hair. In mammals, many protein substrates of cornification are encoded by a cluster of genes, termed the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC). To provide a basis for hypotheses about the evolution of cornification proteins, we screened for homologs of the EDC in non-mammalian vertebrates. By comparative genomics, de novo gene prediction and gene expression analyses, we show that, in contrast to fish and amphibians, the chicken and the green anole lizard have EDC homologs comprising genes that are specifically expressed in the epidermis and in skin appendages. Our data suggest that an important component of the cornified protein envelope of mammalian keratinocytes, that is, loricrin, has originated in a common ancestor of modern amniotes, perhaps during the acquisition of a fully terrestrial lifestyle. Moreover, we provide evidence that the sauropsid-specific beta-keratins have evolved as a subclass of EDC genes. Based on the comprehensive characterization of the arrangement, exon-intron structures and conserved sequence elements of EDC genes, we propose new scenarios for the evolutionary origin of epidermal barrier proteins via fusion of neighboring S100A and peptidoglycan recognition protein genes, subsequent loss of exons and highly divergent sequence evolution.},

	Abstract = {The oxytocin (OT) family of neuropeptides are known to modulate social behaviours and anxiety in mammals and birds. We investigated cell numbers and neural activity, assessed as Fos induction, within magnocellular and parvocellular populations of neurons producing the OT homologue mesotocin (MT, Ile(8)-oxytocin). This was conducted within the male brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei, following agonistic or courtship encounters with a conspecific. Both neurons colocalizing and not colocalizing corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) were examined. Parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus exhibited a positive correlation between courtship frequency and Fos colocalization, regardless of whether they produce just MT or MT + CRF. Magnocellular populations showed only trends towards positive relationships with courtship and no cell populations showed aggression-related Fos induction. These findings are novel because they demonstrate the involvement of MT neurons in male social behaviour, especially in reptiles for whom the involvement of MT in social behaviour was previously unknown.},

	Abstract = {Arginine vasotocin (AVT) is a potent regulator of social behavior in many species, but little is known about its role in reptilian behavior. Here we examine the effect of exogenous AVT on aggressive responding and courtship behavior in the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). Aggressive behavior was stimulated in two ways: (1) mirror presentation (no relative status formed) and (2) size-matched pairs (where a social status is achieved). To elicit courtship behavior, a novel female was introduced into the home cage of a male. Regardless of the behavior condition, male anoles were injected i.p. with either reptile Ringer solution (vehicle) or AVT prior to testing. Animals treated with AVT performed fewer aggressive display bouts during mirror presentation but AVT treatment did not affect the overall number of aggressive display bouts within size-matched pairs. Male courtship behavior was not affected by AVT; however, untreated females displayed more frequently when paired with an AVT-treated male than a vehicle-injected control, suggesting that AVT-treated males were more attractive to females. Regardless of behavior condition, AVT injections led to increases in circulating corticosterone. Overall, we found that AVT tended to reduce aggressive behavior as has been reported for other territorial species. AVT did not perceptibly alter male courtship but did increase the display behavior of untreated females paired with treated males. Our study supports a role for AVT in the regulation of reptile social behavior.},

	Abstract = {Lizards, which are amniote vertebrates like humans, are able to lose and regenerate a functional tail. Understanding the molecular basis of this process would advance regenerative approaches in amniotes, including humans. We have carried out the first transcriptomic analysis of tail regeneration in a lizard, the green anole Anolis carolinensis, which revealed 326 differentially expressed genes activating multiple developmental and repair mechanisms. Specifically, genes involved in wound response, hormonal regulation, musculoskeletal development, and the Wnt and MAPK/FGF pathways were differentially expressed along the regenerating tail axis. Furthermore, we identified 2 microRNA precursor families, 22 unclassified non-coding RNAs, and 3 novel protein-coding genes significantly enriched in the regenerating tail. However, high levels of progenitor/stem cell markers were not observed in any region of the regenerating tail. Furthermore, we observed multiple tissue-type specific clusters of proliferating cells along the regenerating tail, not localized to the tail tip. These findings predict a different mechanism of regeneration in the lizard than the blastema model described in the salamander and the zebrafish, which are anamniote vertebrates. Thus, lizard tail regrowth involves the activation of conserved developmental and wound response pathways, which are potential targets for regenerative medical therapies.},

	Abstract = {The localization of specific claw beta-proteins among the 40 total corneous beta-proteins present in the lizard Anolis carolinensis is not known. The hardness of claws likely depends on glycine-cysteine-rich beta-proteins content, as suggested by previous immunoblot studies. Previous studies have indicated that glycine-cysteine-rich corneous beta-proteins in addition to cysteine-rich alpha-keratins are present in the claw. In order to detect at the ultrastructural level the presence of claw-specific corneous proteins immunofluorescence and electron microscopy immunogold have been utilized. More intense immunoreactivity is obtained for the HgGC3 beta-protein while less intense immunolabeling is seen for HgGC10 and HgG5 beta-proteins and no labeling for the cysteine-rich beta-protein HgC1. The HgGC3 beta-protein appears the prevalent type present in the claw and its numerous cysteines likely form intermolecular disulphide bonds while glycine contributes hydrophobic properties to the corneous material. Other antibodies tagging the core-box and pre-core box regions of beta-proteins label with less intensity the corneous layer. The presence of cysteine-rich alpha-keratins with high homology to some human hair keratins in the dorsal part of the claw suggests that HgGC3-like beta-proteins form numerous disulphide bonds with the larger alpha-keratins giving rise to the hard corneous material of the claw.},

	Abstract = {Exploring the relationship between phenotype and performance in an ecological and evolutionary context is crucial to understanding the adaptive nature of phenotypic traits. Despite their ubiquity in vertebrates, few studies have examined the functional and ecological significance of claw morphologies. Here we examine the adhesive toepad and claw system of Anolis lizards. Claw characters are significantly different between lizards classified as arboreal (perch height>/=1m) and non-arboreal (perch height<1m). Arboreal species possess significantly higher and longer claws, and show trends toward decreased claw curvature and wider claw tip angles. Toepad size and claw length and height are tightly correlated with each other and with perch height, suggesting that the adhesive toepad and gripping claw have co-evolved to accommodate different habitats. The functional morphology and evolution of claws are ripe areas for future investigation.},

	Abstract = {Size matched male green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) were paired in a neutral setting and allowed to engage in aggressive displays. Winners and losers were apparent in each pair within 90min, resulting in stable dominant/subordinate dyads. Androgen receptor (AR) expression was assessed at three time points after the initial pairing, 2h, 3 days, and 10 days in dominants, subordinates, and two groups of control males housed alone or with a female for an equal period of time. Expression was quantified in three forebrain areas that have been implicated in aggression and reproductive social behavior in this species, the preoptic area (POA), the anterior hypothalamus (AH), septal area (SEP), and ventromedial nucleus of the posterior division of the dorsal ventricular ridge (PDVRVM ). There were significant overall group differences in AR mRNA expression in the POA and AH that appeared to result from higher POA AR expression in dominant males compared to other groups, and generally lower AR expression in subordinate males. Pairwise comparison revealed that dominants' AR mRNA expression in the POA was significantly higher in the 2h and 3 day groups compared to that of subordinates, with a similar, but nonsignificant, difference in the 10 day group. Dominants had significantly higher AR mRNA expression in the AH compared to that of subordinates in the 2h group, but differences were not significant at later times. The results suggest that POA and AH sensitivity to androgens is increased in dominants compared to subordinates, and that the difference can be seen soon after the agonistic interaction establishing winners and losers.},

@article{Powell:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Across vertebrates, there is a broad correlation between neuroanatomy and the type of habitat preferred by a species. In general, species occupying habitats classified as more structurally complex have relatively larger brains and exaggerated structures related to navigating and exploiting those habitats. We empirically measured the structural habitat complexity of six species of Puerto Rican Anolis lizards, which have traditionally been classified as occupying three distinct habitat types. We also measured the volume of the whole brain as well as six structures putatively related to exploiting complex habitats in these species. We found a significant interspecific variation in structural habitat complexity, including a substantial variation between those belonging to the same ecomorph category. Despite this, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that interspecific differences in habitat preferences, particularly differences in the relative structural complexity of those habitats, can favor a divergence in neuroanatomy. However, our findings indicate that, at a finer scale, species preferences for structural habitats vary greatly between Anolis species belonging to the same ecomorph category. This variation might contribute to the community structure of anoles by allowing multiple sympatric species of the same ecomorph category to occupy what, at a coarse scale, appears to be the same structural niche. We propose that, in the case of arboreal species, differences in the complexity of arboreal habitats alone may not be sufficient to favor divergent brain evolution.},

	Abstract = {The course of the medial ridge in the lizard jugal shows considerable morphological variation. There are four basic configurations: (1) the medial ridge is located ventral to mid-height on the suborbital process and anterior to mid-length on the postorbital process; (2) the medial ridge is located ventrally on the suborbital process (as above), but posteriorly on the postorbital process; (3) the medial ridge is located dorsally on the suborbital process and anteriorly on the postorbital process; and (4) the medial ridge is centrally located along the entire length of the jugal. Ancestral character state reconstruction shows that type 1 is plesiomorphic for Squamata regardless of the broad-scale phylogenetic topology. Type 3 is present in chamaeleonids and convergently in Anolis barbatus. Type 3 is a synapomorphy of the chamaeleonids. Type 2 is considered plesiomorphic for Anguidae, Heloderma and Xenosaurus, although it is independently modified in some extant members. These taxa form a clade in molecular phylogenies of Squamata, and the course of the medial ridge of the jugal therefore provides some measure of morphological support for this arrangement. The course of the medial ridge may be best explained by the position of the eye and by the angle of the jugal; its relations with other bony orbital structures (supraocular osteoderms, palpebral, supraorbital flanges) and the posterior extent of the maxilla are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {We examined the diversity of the musculoskeletal morphology in the limbs of Anolis lizards with different habitats and identified variations in functional and morphological adaptations to different ecologies or behaviors. Dissection and isolation of 40 muscles from the fore- and hindlimbs of five species of Anolis were performed, and the muscle mass and length of the moment arm were compared after body size effects were removed. Ecologically and behaviorally characteristic morphological differences were observed in several muscles. Well-developed hindlimb extensors were observed in ground-dwelling species, A. sagrei and A. bremeri, and were considered advantageous for running, whereas adept climber species possessed expanded femoral retractors for weight-bearing during climbing. Moreover, morphological variations were observed among arboreal species. Wider excursions of the forelimb joint characterized A. porcatus, presumably enabling branch-to-branch locomotion, while A. equestris and A. angusticeps possessed highly developed adductor muscles for grasping thick branches or twigs. These findings suggest divergent evolution of musculoskeletal characteristic in the limbs within the genus Anolis, with correlations observed among morphological traits, locomotor performance, and habitat uses.},

During this screening, three new AdVs were detected. One of these viruses was detected in three lizards from a group of green striped tree dragons (Japalura splendida). Another was detected in a green anole (Anolis carolinensis). A third virus was detected in a Jackson's chameleon (Chamaeleo jacksonii). Analysis of a portion of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase genes of each of these viruses revealed that they all were different from one another and from all previously described reptilian AdVs. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial DNA polymerase gene sequence showed that all newly detected viruses clustered within the genus Atadenovirus. This is the first description of AdVs in these lizard species.},

@article{Gredler:2015aa,
	Abstract = {In most amniotes, the intromittent organ is a single phallus; however, squamates (lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenians) have paired hemiphalluses. All amniotes studied to date initiate external genital development with the formation of paired genital swellings. In mammals, archosaurs, and turtles, these swellings merge to form a single genital tubercle, the precursor of the penis and clitoris; however, in squamates, the paired genital buds remain separate, giving rise to the hemiphalluses (hemipenes in males and hemiclitores in females). Although the molecular genetics and sexual differentiation of the genital tubercle have been investigated in mammals and birds, little is known about hemiphallus development. Here we describe development of the cloaca and hemiphallus in the green anole, Anolis carolinensis. Each hemiphallus originates as a protuberance that emerges at the ventral base of the hindlimb bud. Development of the hemipenes resembles penis development; however, differences exist in their tissue composition, morphogenesis, and gene expression patterns. These findings reveal aspects of phallus development that appear to be evolutionarily labile, both within squamates and more broadly among reptiles, and identify features that are conserved across amniotes. Our results, together with parallel studies in other reptilian taxa, suggest potential mechanisms for the diversification of external genital form.},

	Abstract = {The members of the paired box (Pax) family regulate key developmental pathways in many metazoans as tissue-specific transcription factors. Vertebrate genomes typically possess nine Pax genes (Pax1-9), which are derived from four proto-Pax genes in the vertebrate ancestor that were later expanded through the so-called two-round (2R) whole-genome duplication. A recent study proposed that pax6a genes of a subset of teleost fishes (namely, acanthopterygians) are remnants of a paralog generated in the 2R genome duplication, to be renamed pax6.3, and reported one more group of vertebrate Pax genes (Pax6.2), most closely related to the Pax4/6 class. We propose to designate this new member Pax10 instead and reconstruct the evolutionary history of the Pax4/6/10 class with solid phylogenetic evidence. Our synteny analysis showed that Pax4, -6, and -10 originated in the 2R genome duplications early in vertebrate evolution. The phylogenetic analyses of relationships between teleost pax6a and other Pax4, -6, and -10 genes, however, do not support the proposed hypothesis of an ancient origin of the acanthopterygian pax6a genes in the 2R genome duplication. Instead, we confirmed the traditional scenario that the acanthopterygian pax6a is derived from the more recent teleost-specific genome duplication. Notably, Pax6 is present in all vertebrates surveyed to date, whereas Pax4 and -10 were lost multiple times in independent vertebrate lineages, likely because of their restricted expression patterns: Among Pax6-positive domains, Pax10 has retained expression in the adult retina alone, which we documented through in situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction experiments on zebrafish, Xenopus, and anole lizard.},

	Abstract = {Ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) is a conserved protein of the mammalian cytosol. RI binds with high affinity to diverse secretory ribonucleases (RNases) and inhibits their enzymatic activity. Although secretory RNases are found in all vertebrates, the existence of a non-mammalian RI has been uncertain. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of RI homologs from chicken and anole lizard. These proteins bind to RNases from multiple species but exhibit much greater affinity for their cognate RNases than for mammalian RNases. To reveal the basis for this differential affinity, we determined the crystal structure of mouse, bovine, and chicken RI.RNase complexes to a resolution of 2.20, 2.21, and 1.92A, respectively. A combination of structural, computational, and bioinformatic analyses enabled the identification of two residues that appear to contribute to the differential affinity for RNases. We also found marked differences in oxidative instability between mammalian and non-mammalian RIs, indicating evolution toward greater oxygen sensitivity in RIs from mammalian species. Taken together, our results illuminate the structural and functional evolution of RI, along with its dynamic role in vertebrate biology.},

	Abstract = {Human-mediated colonizations present an informative model system for understanding assembly of organismal communities. However, it is unclear whether communities including naturalized species are accurate analogs of natural communities or unique combinations not present in nature. I compared morphology and phylogenetic structure of natural and naturalized two-species communities of Anolis lizards. Natural communities are phylogenetically clustered, whereas naturalized communities show no significant phylogenetic structure. This result likely reflects differences in colonization pools for these communities-that is, invasion from anywhere for naturalized communities but from proximal and thus phylogenetically close lineages in natural communities. Both natural and naturalized communities each include pairs of species that are significantly similar to each other in morphology, and both sets of communities are composed of species that possess traits of good colonizers. These similarities suggest that the formation of natural and naturalized communities may be at least partially governed by similar processes. Human-mediated invasions may be credibly viewed as modern incarnations of natural colonizations in this case.},

	Abstract = {AIM: Quercetin is an effective Hsp27 inhibitor and has been reported to facilitate tumor cell apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether quercetin could sensitize human glioblastoma cells to temozolomide (TMZ) in vitro. METHODS: Both U251 and U87 human glioblastoma cells were treated with quercetin and/or TMZ for 48 h. Cell viability was detected using the MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed with caspase-3 activity kits and flow cytometry. Hsp27 expression and phosphorylation were examined using Western blot analysis. RNA interference using Hsp27 siRNA oligos was performed to knock down the gene expression of Hsp27. RESULTS: TMZ (200 or 400 mumol/L) alone effectively inhibited the viability of U251 and U87 cells. When combined with quercetin (30 mumol/L), TMZ (100 mumol/L) significantly inhibited the cell viability, and the inhibition of TMZ (200 and 400 mumol/L) was enhanced. TMZ or quercetin anole did not affect caspase-3 activity and cell apoptosis, while TMZ combined with quercetin significantly increased caspase-3 activity and induced cell apoptosis. TMZ anole significantly increased Hsp27 phosphorylation in U251 and U87 cells, while quercetin or Hsp27 siRNA oligos combined with TMZ attenuated TMZ-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation and significantly inhibited Hsp27 expression. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment with TMZ and quercetin efficiently suppressed human glioblastoma cell survival in vitro.},

The new species is morphologically similar to Anolis ibanezi and A. chocorum, but differs in body and dewlap color, and head scalation. We performed an exploratory multivariate analysis based on 15 morphological characteristics of the new species and A chocorum and found that differences between both species are mainly associated with head dimensions. A phylogenetic analysis based on morphological characters suggests that the new species is nested within the "Dactyloa" clade of Anolis. Finally, we discuss phylogenetic relationships and biogeographical affinities based in its distribution.},

However, a comparison of the syntypes and additional topotypical specimens of A. boulengerianus with three topoparatypes and additional specimens of the species currently referred to as Anolis isthmicus Fitch, 1978 showed that these two names pertain to the same species. Because of the priority principle, A. isthmicus becomes a junior synonym of A. boulengerianus.

Anolis peucephilus differs from all congeners by having a combination of (1) smooth ventral scales; (2) usually a patch of three greatly enlarged supraocular scales; (3) extremely short hind legs, longest toe of adpressed hind leg reaching to a point between levels of axilla and ear opening, ratio shank length/snout-vent length 0.18-0.21; (4) circumnasal usually in contact with first supralabial; and (5) a large yellowish orange dewlap in males and a very small to small white dewlap in females. In external morphology, A. peucephilus is most similar to A. omiltemanus from which it differs by having even shorter hind legs with the longest toe of adpressed hind leg reaching to a point between levels of axilla and ear opening (versus usually to ear opening, occasionally to slightly beyond ear opening or to a point between shoulder and ear opening in A. omiltemanus), a slightly larger dewlap in females, to 64 mm2 (versus to 41 mm2 in A. omiltemanus), the circumnasal usually in contact with the first supralabial (versus those scales separated by the presence of a subnasal in A. omiltemanus), and 4-6 internasal scales in the new species (versus usually 6-7 in A. omiltemanus). Furthermore, A. peucephilus differs from A. omiltemanus in hemipenial morphology (no finger-like processus on asulcate side in A. peucephilus versus such a processus present in A. omiltemanus). Also, in a preliminary molecular genetic analysis of the mitochondrial CO1 gene fragment, A. peucephilus has a genetic distance of 11.5% from A. omiltemanus. Anolis peucephilus was collected at night while the lizards were sleeping in pine trees, 2-10 m above the ground.},

	Abstract = {Knowledge of beta-protein (beta-keratin) sequences in Anolis carolinensis facilitates the localization of specific sites in the skin of this lizard. The epidermal distribution of two new beta-proteins (betakeratins), HgGC8 and HgG13, has been analyzed by Western blotting, light and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry. HgGC8 includes 16 kDa members of the glycine-cysteine medium-rich subfamily and is mainly expressed in the beta-layer of adhesive setae but not in the setae. HgGC8 is absent in other epidermal layers of the setae and is weakly expressed in the beta-layer of other scales. HgG13 comprises members of 17-kDa glycine-rich proteins and is absent in the setae, diffusely distributed in the beta layer of digital scales and barely present in the beta-layer of other scales. It appears that the specialized glycine-cysteine medium rich beta-proteins such as HgGC8 in the beta-layer, and of HgGC10 and HgGC3 in both alpha- and betalayers, are key proteins in the formation of the flexible epidermal layers involved in the function of these modified scales in adaptation to contact and adhesion on surfaces.},

	Abstract = {Signaling individuals must effectively capture and hold the attention of intended conspecific receivers while limiting eavesdropping by potential predators. A possible mechanism for achieving this balance is for individuals to modulate the physical properties of their signals or to alter the proportion of time spent signaling, depending upon local levels of predation pressure. We test the hypothesis that prey can alter their visual signaling behavior to decrease conspicuousness and potentially limit predation risk via modulation of signal properties or display rate. To do so, we conducted a manipulative experiment in nature to evaluate the possible effect of predation pressure on the physical properties of movement-based signals and on the proportion of time spent signaling by using a well-understood predator-prey system in the Bahamas, the semiarboreal lizard Anolis sagrei, and one of its main predators, the curly-tailed lizard Leiocephalus carinatus. We find that on islands onto which the predator was introduced, male anoles reduce the maximum amplitude of head-bob displays but not the proportion of time spent signaling, in comparison with control islands lacking the predator. This reduction of amplitude also decreases signal active space, which might alter the reproductive success of signaling individuals. We suggest that future studies of predator-prey interactions consider the risk effects generated by changes in signals or signaling behavior to fully determine the influence of predation pressure on the dynamics of prey populations.},

	Abstract = {The sand lizard (Lacerta agilis, Lacertidae) has a chromosome number of 2n = 38, with 17 pairs of acrocentric chromosomes, one pair of microchromosomes, a large acrocentric Z chromosome, and a micro-W chromosome. To investigate the process of karyotype evolution in L. agilis, we performed chromosome banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization for gene mapping and constructed a cytogenetic map with 86 functional genes. Chromosome banding revealed that the Z chromosome is the fifth largest chromosome. The cytogenetic map revealed homology of the L. agilis Z chromosome with chicken chromosomes 6 and 9. Comparison of the L. agilis cytogenetic map with those of four Toxicofera species with many microchromosomes (Elaphe quadrivirgata, Varanus salvator macromaculatus, Leiolepis reevesii rubritaeniata, and Anolis carolinensis) showed highly conserved linkage homology of L. agilis chromosomes (LAG) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5(Z), 7, 8, 9, and 10 with macrochromosomes and/or macrochromosome segments of the four Toxicofera species. Most of the genes located on the microchromosomes of Toxicofera were localized to LAG6, small acrocentric chromosomes (LAG11-18), and a microchromosome (LAG19) in L. agilis. These results suggest that the L. agilis karyotype resulted from frequent fusions of microchromosomes, which occurred in the ancestral karyotype of Toxicofera and led to the disappearance of microchromosomes and the appearance of many small macrochromosomes.},

Here, we integrate new phylogenomic sequences from 1,448 nuclear DNA loci totaling almost 1 million bp from the extinct little bush moa, Chilean tinamou, and emu with available sequences from ostrich, elegant crested tinamou, four neognaths, and the green anole. Phylogenetic analysis using standard homogeneous models and heterogeneous models robust to common topological artifacts recovered compelling support for ratite paraphyly with the little bush moa closest to tinamous within ratites. Ratite paraphyly was further corroborated by eight independent CR1 retroposon insertions. Analysis of morphological characters reinterpreted on a 27-gene paleognath topology indicates that many characters are convergent in the ratites, probably as the result of adaptation to a cursorial life style.},

	Abstract = {Sexual dimorphisms vary widely among species. This variation must arise through sex-specific evolutionary modifications to developmental processes. Anolis lizards vary extensively in their expression of cranial dimorphism. Compared with other Anolis species, members of the carolinensis clade have evolved relatively high levels of cranial dimorphism; males of this clade have exceptionally long faces relative to conspecific females. Developmentally, this facial length dimorphism arises through an evolutionarily novel, clade-specific strategy. Our analyses herein reveal that sex-specific regulation of the oestrogen pathway underlies evolution of this exaggerated male phenotype, rather than the androgen or insulin growth factor pathways that have long been considered the primary regulators of male-biased dimorphism among vertebrates. Our results suggest greater intricacy in the genetic mechanisms that underlie sexual dimorphisms than previously appreciated.},

	Abstract = {The chicken (Gallus gallus) melanocortin-2 receptor (cMC2R) can be functionally expressed in CHO cells when chicken melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein 1 (cMRAP1) is co-expressed. The transiently transfected CHO cells responded in a robust manner to stimulation by hACTH(1-24) (EC50 value=2.7 x 10(-12)M +/- 1.3 x 10(-12)), but the transfected CHO cells could not be stimulated by NDP-MSH at concentrations as high as 10(-7)M. Incubation of cMC2R/cMRAP1 transfected cells with alanine substituted analogs of hACTH(1-24) at amino acid positions F(7) or W(9) completely blocked stimulation of the transfected cells. Similarly, incubation of cMC2R/cMRAP1 transfected cells with an analog of hACTH(1-24) with alanine substitutions at amino acid positions R(17)R(18)P(19) resulted in a 276 fold shift in EC50 value relative to the positive control (p<0.004). Collectively these observations suggest that cMC2R has binding sites for the HFRW motif and KKRRP motif of hACTH(1-24), and both motifs are required for full activation of the receptor. While previous studies had shown that Anolis carolinensis MC2R and Xenopus tropicalis MC2R could be functionally expressed in CHO cells that co-expressed mouse MRAP1, co-expression of these non-mammalian tetrapod MC2Rs with cMRAP1 resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity to hACTH(1-24), as measured by EC50 value, for A. carolinensis MC2R (p<0.005) and X. tropicalis MC2R (p<0.007). The implications of these observations are discussed.},

@article{Cox:2014aa,
	Abstract = {The ubiquitous life-history trade-off between reproduction and survival has long been hypothesized to reflect underlying energy-allocation trade-offs between reproductive investment and processes related to self-maintenance. Although recent work has questioned whether energy-allocation models provide sufficient explanations for the survival cost of reproduction, direct tests of this hypothesis are rare, especially in wild populations. This hypothesis was tested in a wild population of brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) using a two-step experiment. First, stepwise variation in reproductive investment was created using unilateral and bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) along with intact (SHAM) control. Next, this manipulation was decoupled from its downstream effects on energy storage by surgically ablating the abdominal fat stores from half of the females in each reproductive treatment. As predicted, unilateral OVX (intermediate reproductive investment) induced levels of growth, body condition, fat storage and breeding-season survival that were intermediate between the high levels of bilateral OVX (no reproductive investment) and the low levels of SHAM (full reproductive investment). Ablation of abdominal fat bodies had a strong and persistent effect on energy stores, but it did not influence post-breeding survival in any of the three reproductive treatments. This suggests that the energetic savings of reduced reproductive investment do not directly enhance post-breeding survival, with the caveat that only one aspect of energy storage was manipulated and OVX itself had no overall effect on post-breeding survival. This study supports the emerging view that simple energy-allocation models may often be insufficient as explanations for the life-history trade-off between reproduction and survival.},

Two species of coccidians were found, including a new caryosporan and a new eimerian. Oocysts of Caryospora natchitochesensis n. sp. from a single A. carolinensis from Louisiana were subspheroidal to ovoidal with a smooth, yellow-to-brown-pigmented, bilayered wall of equal thickness ( approximately 0.3-0.7) and measured (L x W) 13.1 x 12.3 mum, with a length/width (L/W) ratio of 1.1. A micropyle and oocyst residuum were absent, but a polar granule was present. Sporocysts were ovoidal and measured 10.1 x 7.4 mum, L/W was 1.4. A Stieda body ( approximately 1.0 mum) was present, but substieda and parastieda bodies were absent. The sporocyst residuum was composed of dispersed granules or globules among sporozoites. Oocysts of Eimeria robisoni n. sp. from 1 of 12 (8%) green anoles from Arkansas were ellipsoidal with a smooth, unilayered wall ( approximately 0.4-0.5) and measured (L x W) 14.5 x 10.5 mum, with L/W ratio of 1.4. A micropyle and oocyst residuum were absent, but 1-4 (usually 2) polar granules were present. Sporocysts were subspheroidal to ovoidal and measured 5.8 x 4.9 mum, L/W was 1.2. Stieda, substieda, and parastieda bodies were absent. The sporocyst residuum was composed of dispersed granules between sporozoites. None of the anoles from Oklahoma was found to be passing oocysts. This is the second time an eimerian and a caryosporan have been reported from green anoles.

@article{Husak:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Variation in aggression among species can be due to a number of proximate and ultimate factors, leading to patterns of divergent and convergent evolution of behavior among even closely related species. Caribbean Anolis lizards are well known for their convergence in microhabitat use and morphology, but they also display marked convergence in social behavior and patterns of aggression. We studied 18 Anolis species across six ecomorphs on four different Caribbean islands to test four main hypotheses. We hypothesized that species differences in aggression would be due to species differences in circulating testosterone (T), a steroid hormone implicated in numerous studies across vertebrate taxa as a primary determinant of social behavior; more aggressive species were expected to have higher baseline concentrations of T and corticosterone. We further hypothesized that low-T species would increase T and corticosterone levels during a social challenge. Within three of the four island assemblages studied we found differences in T levels among species within an island that differ in aggression, but in the opposite pattern than predicted: more aggressive species had lower baseline T than the least aggressive species. The fourth island, Puerto Rico, showed the pattern of baseline T levels among species we predicted. There were no patterns of corticosterone levels among species or ecomorphs. One of the two species tested increased T in response to a social challenge, but neither species elevated corticosterone. Our results suggest that it is possible for similarities in aggression among closely related species to evolve via different proximate mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Sympatric species that initially overlap in resource use are expected to partition the environment in ways that will minimize interspecific competition. This shift in resource use can in turn prompt evolutionary changes in morphology. A classic example of habitat partitioning and morphological differentiation are the Caribbean Anolis lizards. Less well studied, but nevertheless striking analogues to the Anolis are the Southeast Asian Draco lizards. Draco and Anolis have evolved independently of each other for at least 80 million years. Their comparison subsequently offers a special opportunity to examine mechanisms of phenotypic differentiation between two ecologically diverse, but phylogenetically distinct groups. We tested whether Draco shared ecological axes of differentiation with Anolis (e.g., habitat use), whether this differentiation reflected interspecific competition, and to what extent adaptive change in morphology has occurred along these ecological axes. Using existing data on Anolis, we compared the habitat use and morphology of Draco in a field study of allopatric and sympatric species on the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and in the Philippines. Sympatric Draco lizards partitioned the environment along common resource axes to the Anolis lizards, especially in perch use. Furthermore, the morphology of Draco was correlated with perch use in the same way as it was in Anolis: species that used wider perches exhibited longer limb lengths. These results provide an important illustration of how interspecific competition can occur along common ecological axes in different animal groups, and how natural selection along these axes can generate the same type of adaptive change in morphology.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene family uniquely illustrates the concept of enzymogenesis. In vertebrates, tandem duplications gave rise to a multiplicity of forms that have been classified in eight enzyme classes, according to primary structure and function. Some of these classes appear to be exclusive of particular organisms, such as the frog ADH8, a unique NADP+-dependent ADH enzyme. This work describes the ADH system of Xenopus, as a model organism, and explores the first amphibian and reptilian genomes released in order to contribute towards a better knowledge of the vertebrate ADH gene family. RESULTS: Xenopus cDNA and genomic sequences along with expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were used in phylogenetic analyses and structure-function correlations of amphibian ADHs. Novel ADH sequences identified in the genomes of Anolis carolinensis (anole lizard) and Pelodiscus sinensis (turtle) were also included in these studies. Tissue and stage-specific libraries provided expression data, which has been supported by mRNA detection in Xenopus laevis tissues and regulatory elements in promoter regions. Exon-intron boundaries, position and orientation of ADH genes were deduced from the amphibian and reptilian genome assemblies, thus revealing syntenic regions and gene rearrangements with respect to the human genome. Our results reveal the high complexity of the ADH system in amphibians, with eleven genes, coding for seven enzyme classes in Xenopus tropicalis. Frogs possess the amphibian-specific ADH8 and the novel ADH1-derived forms ADH9 and ADH10. In addition, they exhibit ADH1, ADH2, ADH3 and ADH7, also present in reptiles and birds. Class-specific signatures have been assigned to ADH7, and ancestral ADH2 is predicted to be a mixed-class as the ostrich enzyme, structurally close to mammalian ADH2 but with class-I kinetic properties. Remarkably, many ADH1 and ADH7 forms are observed in the lizard, probably due to lineage-specific duplications. ADH4 is not present in amphibians and reptiles. CONCLUSIONS: The study of the ancient forms of ADH2 and ADH7 sheds new light on the evolution of the vertebrate ADH system, whereas the special features showed by the novel forms point to the acquisition of new functions following the ADH gene family expansion which occurred in amphibians.},

	Abstract = {Environmental conditions that reproductive females experience can influence patterns of offspring provisioning and fitness. In particular, prey availability can influence maternal reproduction and, in turn, affect the viability of their offspring. Although such maternal effects are widespread, the mechanisms by which these effects operate are poorly understood. We manipulated the amount of prey available to female brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) to evaluate how this factor affects patterns of reproductive investment (total egg output, egg size, yolk steroids) and offspring viability (morphology, growth, survival). Experimental reduction of yolk in a subset of eggs enabled us to evaluate a potential causal mechanism (yolk investment) that mediates the effect of maternal prey availability on offspring viability. We show that limited prey availability significantly reduced egg size, which negatively influenced offspring size, growth, and survival. Experimental yolk removal from eggs directly reduced offspring size, which, in turn, negatively affected offspring growth and survival. These findings show that maternal environments (i.e., low prey) can affect offspring fitness via an indirect effect of yolk investment on offspring size and highlight the complex set of indirect effects by which maternal effects can operate.},

	Abstract = {Successful locomotion through complex, heterogeneous environments requires the muscles that power locomotion to function effectively under a wide variety of conditions. Although considerable data exist on how animals modulate both kinematics and motor pattern when confronted with orientation (i.e. incline) demands, little is known about the modulation of muscle function in response to changes in structural demands like substrate diameter, compliance and texture. Here, we used high-speed videography and electromyography to examine how substrate incline and perch diameter affected the kinematics and muscle function of both the forelimb and hindlimb in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis). Surprisingly, we found a decoupling of the modulation of kinematics and motor activity, with kinematics being more affected by perch diameter than by incline, and muscle function being more affected by incline than by perch diameter. Also, muscle activity was most stereotyped on the broad, vertical condition, suggesting that, despite being classified as a trunk-crown ecomorph, this species may prefer trunks. These data emphasize the complex interactions between the processes that underlie animal movement and the importance of examining muscle function when considering both the evolution of locomotion and the impacts of ecology on function.},

	Abstract = {Reptiles have a diverse array of tooth shapes, from simple unicuspid to complex multicuspid teeth, reflecting functional adaptation to a variety of diets and eating styles. In addition to cusps, often complex longitudinal labial and lingual enamel crests are widespread and contribute to the final shape of reptile teeth. The simplest shaped unicuspid teeth have been found in piscivorous or carnivorous ancestors of recent diapsid reptiles and they are also present in some extant carnivores such as crocodiles and snakes. However, the ancestral tooth shape for squamate reptiles is thought to be bicuspid, indicating an insectivorous diet. The development of bicuspid teeth in lizards has recently been published, indicating that the mechanisms used to create cusps and crests are very distinct from those that shape cusps in mammals. Here, we introduce the large variety of tooth shapes found in lizards and compare the morphology and development of bicuspid, tricuspid, and pentacuspid teeth, with the aim of understanding how such tooth shapes are generated. Next, we discuss whether the processes used to form such morphologies are conserved between divergent lizards and whether the underlying mechanisms share similarities with those of mammals. In particular, we will focus on the complex teeth of the chameleon, gecko, varanus, and anole lizards using SEM and histology to compare the tooth crown morphology and embryonic development.},

	Abstract = {Many poikilothermic vertebrate lineages, especially among amphibians and fishes, possess a rapid turnover of sex chromosomes, while in endotherms there is a notable stability of sex chromosomes. Reptiles in general exhibit variability in sex-determining systems; as typical poikilotherms, they might be expected to have a rapid turnover of sex chromosomes. However, molecular data which would enable the testing of the stability of sex chromosomes are lacking in most lineages. Here, we provide molecular evidence that sex chromosomes are highly conserved across iguanas, one of the most species-rich clade of reptiles. We demonstrate that members of the New World families Iguanidae, Tropiduridae, Leiocephalidae, Phrynosomatidae, Dactyloidae and Crotaphytidae, as well as of the family Opluridae which is restricted to Madagascar, all share homologous sex chromosomes. As our sampling represents the majority of the phylogenetic diversity of iguanas, the origin of iguana sex chromosomes can be traced back in history to the basal splitting of this group which occurred during the Cretaceous period. Iguanas thus show a stability of sex chromosomes comparable to mammals and birds and represent the group with the oldest sex chromosomes currently known among amniotic poikilothermic vertebrates.},

	Abstract = {The LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA) measures global DNA methylation. LUMA depends on digestion of DNA with methyl-sensitive and methyl-insensitive restriction enzymes, followed by pyrosequencing. Until recently, LUMA has been principally used for biomedical research. Here, we use chickens as a model to investigate sample quality issues relating to LUMA and then apply the method to ecological species. First, we assessed the effect of tissue storage conditions on DNA methylation values. This is an important consideration for ecological species because samples are not always ideally preserved and LUMA is sensitive to poor DNA quality. We found that good quality LUMA data could be obtained from chicken liver and brain tissues stored at 21 degrees C for at least 2 and 12 h, respectively. Longer storage times introduced nonspecific peaks to pyrograms which were associated with reduced DNA methylation. Repeatedly, freezing and thawing the tissues did not affect LUMA data. Second, we measured DNA methylation in 12 species representing five animal classes: amphibians (African and Western clawed frog), reptiles (green anole lizard), fish (yellow perch, goldfish, lake trout), mammals (American mink, polar bear, short-beaked common dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin) and birds (chicken, Japanese quail). We saw a pattern of high DNA methylation in fish (84-87%), and intermediate levels in mammals (68-72%) and birds (52-71%). This pattern corresponds well with previous measures of DNA methylation generated by HPLC. Our data represent the first CpG methylation values to be reported in several species and provide a basis for studying patterns of epigenetic inheritance in an ecological context.},

	Abstract = {COMMUNITIES ARE THOUGHT TO BE ASSEMBLED BY TWO TYPES OF FILTERS: by the environment relating to the fundamental niche and by biotic interactions relating to the realized niche. Both filters include parameters related to functional traits and their variation along environmental gradients. Here, we infer the general importance of environmental filtering of a functional trait determining local community assembly within insular adaptive radiations on the example of Caribbean Anolis lizards. We constructed maps for the probability of presence of Anolis ecomorphs (ecology-morphology-behavior specialists) on the Greater Antilles and overlaid these to estimate ecomorph community completeness (ECC) over the landscape. We then tested for differences in environmental parameter spaces among islands for real and cross-fitted ECC values to see whether the underlying assembly filters are deterministic (i.e., similar among islands). We then compared information-theoretic models of climatic and landscape parameters among Greater Antillean islands and inferred whether body mass as functional trait determines ECC. We found areas with high ECC to be strongly correlated with environmental filters, partly related to elevation. The environmental parameters influencing high ECC differed among islands. With the exception of the Jamaican twig ecomorph (which we suspect to be misclassified), smaller ecomorphs were more restricted to higher elevations than larger ones which might reflect filtering on the basis of differential physiological restrictions of ecomorphs. Our results in Anolis show that local community assembly within adaptive island radiations of animals can be determined by environmental filtering of functional traits, independently from species composition and realized environmental niche space.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary radiations, especially adaptive radiations, have been widely studied but mainly for recent events such as in cichlid fish or Anolis lizards. Here, we investigate the radiation of the subfamily Cyprininae, which includes more than 1300 species and is estimated to have originated from Southeast Asia around 55 Ma. In order to decipher a potential adaptive radiation, within a solid phylogenetic framework, we investigated the trophic apparatus, and especially the pharyngeal dentition, as teeth have proved to be important markers of ecological specialization. We compared two tribes within Cyprininae, Poropuntiini and Labeonini, displaying divergent dental patterns, as well as other characters related to their trophic apparatus. Our results suggest that the anatomy of the trophic apparatus and diet are clearly correlated and this explains the difference in dental patterns observed between these two tribes. Our results illustrate the diversity of mechanisms that account for species diversity in this very diverse clade: diversification of dental characters from an ancestral pattern on the one hand, conservation of a basal synapomorphy leading to ecological specialization on the other hand. By integrating morphological, ecological and phylogenetic analyses, it becomes possible to investigate ancient radiation events that have shaped the present diversity of species.},

	Abstract = {A major barrier to evolutionary studies of sex determination and sex chromosomes has been a lack of information on the types of sex-determining mechanisms that occur among different species. This is particularly problematic in groups where most species lack visually heteromorphic sex chromosomes, such as fish, amphibians and reptiles, because cytogenetic analyses will fail to identify the sex chromosomes in these species. We describe the use of restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing, or RAD-seq, to identify sex-specific molecular markers and subsequently determine whether a species has male or female heterogamety. To test the accuracy of this technique, we examined the lizard Anolis carolinensis. We performed RAD-seq on seven male and ten female A. carolinensis and found one male-specific molecular marker. Anolis carolinensis has previously been shown to possess male heterogamety and the recently published A. carolinensis genome facilitated the characterization of the sex-specific RAD-seq marker. We validated the male specificity of the new marker using PCR on additional individuals and also found that it is conserved in some other Anolis species. We discuss the utility of using RAD-seq to identify sex-determining mechanisms in other species with cryptic or homomorphic sex chromosomes and the implications for the evolution of male heterogamety in Anolis.},

	Abstract = {The breast-shoulder apparatus (BSA) is a structurally and kinematically complex region of lizards. Compared with the pelvic region it has received little attention, even though its morphological variation is known to be extensive. This variability has seldom been the focus of functional explanation, possibly because the BSA has been difficult to explore as a composite entity. In this study we apply geometric morphometric techniques to the analysis of the BSA in an attempt to more fully understand its configuration in relation to differential use in locomotion. Our approach centers upon the Jamaican radiation of anoline lizards (genus Norops) as a tractable, small monophyletic assemblage consisting of species representing several ecomorphs. We hypothesized that the different species and ecomorphs would exhibit variation in the configuration of the BSA. Our findings indicate that this is so, and is expressed in the component parts of the BSA, although it is subtle except for Norops valencienni (twig ecomorph), which differs greatly in morphology (and behavior) from its island congeners. We further found similarities in the BSA of N. grahami, N. opalinus (both trunk-crown ecomorphs), and N. garmani (crown giant). These outcomes are promising for associating morphology with ecomorphological specialization and for furthering our understanding of the adaptive response of the BSA to demands on the locomotor system.},

	Abstract = {Social behaviors in vertebrates are modulated by catecholamine (CA; dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine) release within the social behavior neural network. Few studies have examined activity across CA populations in relation to social behaviors. The involvement of CAs in social behavior regulation is especially underexplored in reptiles, relative to other amniotes. In this study, we mapped CA populations throughout the brain (excluding retina and olfactory bulb) of the male brown anole lizard, Anolis sagrei, via immunofluorescent visualization of the rate-limiting enzyme for CA synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Colocalization of TH with the immediate early gene product Fos, an indirect marker of neural activity, also enabled us to relate activity in TH-immunoreactive (TH-ir) neurons to appetitive and consummatory sexual and aggressive behaviors. We detected most major TH-ir cell populations that are present in other amniotes (within the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain), although the A15 population was entirely absent. We also detected a few novel or rare cell clusters within the amygdala, medial septum, and inferior raphe. Many CA populations, especially dopaminergic groups, showed increased TH-Fos colocalization in association with appetitive and consummatory sexual behavior expression, while a small number of regions showed increased colocalization in relation to solely consummatory aggression (biting of an opponent). In conclusion, we here map CA populations throughout the brown anole brain and demonstrate evidence for catecholaminergic involvement in appetitive and consummatory sexual behaviors and consummatory aggressive behaviors in this species.},

	Abstract = {Invasive species often encounter novel climatic conditions when they spread outside of their native ranges. Invading populations can respond to novel conditions by acclimation or adaptation of physiological capacities, which may facilitate their spread. We investigated differences in physiological traits among three populations of an invasive lizard, the brown anole (Anolis sagrei), along the latitudinal extent of its invasion in the southeastern United States. We predicted latitudinal clines for most traits based on models of adaptation to climate. Consistent with the latitudinal cline in temperature and moisture, the mean critical thermal minimum and the mean rate of water loss were lowest for lizards in the northern population. Furthermore, these traits acclimated to either temperature or humidity in a direction consistent with adaptive phenotypic plasticity. By contrast, metabolic rates varied among populations but did not conform to our prediction based on a latitudinal cline in temperature. Critical thermal maxima, endurances, and sprint speeds were similar among populations. Despite the idea that tropical lizards have limited capacity for acclimation, we found variation among invasive populations of brown anoles, which could have partially resulted from acclimation. This physiological variation within the invasive range raises questions about the roles of plasticity and adaptation in the success of the invasion.},

	Abstract = {Vertebrates possess diverse sex-determining systems, which differ in evolutionary stability among particular groups. It has been suggested that poikilotherms possess more frequent turnovers of sex chromosomes than homoiotherms, whose effective thermoregulation can prevent the emergence of the sex reversals induced by environmental temperature. Squamate reptiles used to be regarded as a group with an extensive variability in sex determination; however, we document how the rather old radiation of lizards from the genus Anolis, known for exceptional ecomorphological variability, was connected with stability in sex chromosomes. We found that 18 tested species, representing most of the phylogenetic diversity of the genus, share the gene content of their X chromosomes. Furthermore, we discovered homologous sex chromosomes in species of two genera (Sceloporus and Petrosaurus) from the family Phrynosomatidae, serving here as an outgroup to Anolis. We can conclude that the origin of sex chromosomes within iguanas largely predates the Anolis radiation and that the sex chromosomes of iguanas remained conserved for a significant part of their evolutionary history. Next to therian mammals and birds, Anolis lizards therefore represent another adaptively radiated amniote clade with conserved sex chromosomes. We argue that the evolutionary stability of sex-determining systems may reflect an advanced stage of differentiation of sex chromosomes rather than thermoregulation strategy.},

	Abstract = {Understanding how quickly physiological traits evolve is a topic of great interest, particularly in the context of how organisms can adapt in response to climate warming. Adjustment to novel thermal habitats may occur either through behavioural adjustments, physiological adaptation or both. Here, we test whether rates of evolution differ among physiological traits in the cybotoids, a clade of tropical Anolis lizards distributed in markedly different thermal environments on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. We find that cold tolerance evolves considerably faster than heat tolerance, a difference that results because behavioural thermoregulation more effectively shields these organisms from selection on upper than lower temperature tolerances. Specifically, because lizards in very different environments behaviourally thermoregulate during the day to similar body temperatures, divergent selection on body temperature and heat tolerance is precluded, whereas night-time temperatures can only be partially buffered by behaviour, thereby exposing organisms to selection on cold tolerance. We discuss how exposure to selection on physiology influences divergence among tropical organisms and its implications for adaptive evolutionary response to climate warming.},

	Abstract = {The high resistance to infections in lizard wounds suggests that these reptiles possess effective antimicrobial peptides in their tissues. The present immunocytochemical study shows the cellular localization of beta-defensin 27 in tail tissues and in the blood, a defensin previously identified in the lizard Anolis carolinensis through biomolecular methods. Beta-defensin-27 immunoreactivity is only observed in some large granules mainly contained in heterophilic granulocytes that are sparse within the dermis of the skin or in the isolated blood. This peptide is absent in other cell types of the skin, in keratinocytes and in subdermal muscle tissue of the tail in normal conditions. Pre-corneous keratinocytes of the regenerating tail epidermis are unlabeled or show a weak labeling for the peptide only in sparse cytoplasmic areas or in the extracellular spaces among corneocytes of the wound and regenerating epidermis. The study suggests that beta-defensin 27 is normally stored in granulocytes present in the blood or in connective tissues while in the epidermis keratinocytes do not show the presence of this peptide unless these cells are stimulated from injury to produce and likely release beta-defensins.},

	Abstract = {Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a member of the large TRP super family of ion channels and functions as a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel that is activated by various noxious stimuli. TRPA1 was initially identified as a potential mediator of noxious cold stimuli in mammalian nociceptive sensory neurons, while TRPA1s from nonmammalian vertebrates (snakes, green anole lizards, and frogs) were recently reported to be activated by heat, but not cold stimulus. In this study, we examined detailed properties of the green anole TRPA1 channel (gaTRPA1) related to thermal and chemical stimulation in whole-cell and single-channel recordings. Heat activates gaTRPA1 with a temperature threshold for activation of 35.8 degrees C, while heat together with allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), a chemical agonist, had synergistic effects on gaTRPA1 channel activation in that either the temperature threshold or activating AITC concentration was reduced in the presence of the other stimulus. Significant heat-evoked gaTRPA1 activation was observed in the presence but not absence of extracellular Ca(2+). gaTRPA1 channels were also activated by heat and AITC in excised membrane patches with an inside-out configuration. By comparing the kinetics of heat- and AITC-evoked single-channel currents, we defined similarities and differences of gaTRPA1 channel responses to heat and AITC. We observed similar current-voltage relationship and unitary amplitudes for heat- and AITC-evoked currents and found that heat-activated currents showed shorter durations of both open and closed times. Our results suggest that the gaTRPA1 channel is directly activated by heat and chemical stimuli.},

	Abstract = {The green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis) is a model organism for behavior and genomics that is native to the southeastern United States. It is currently thought that the ancestors of modern green anoles dispersed to peninsular Florida from Cuba. However, the climatic changes and geological features responsible for the early diversification of A. carolinensis in North America have remained largely unexplored. This is because previous studies (1) differ in their estimates of the divergence times of populations, (2) are based on a single genetic locus or (3) did not test specific hypotheses regarding the geologic and topographic history of Florida. Here we provide a multi-locus study of green anole genetic diversity and find that the Florida peninsula contains a larger number of genetically distinct populations that are more diverse than those on the continental mainland. As a test of the island refugia hypothesis in Pleistocene Florida, we use a coalescent approach to estimate the divergence times of modern green anole lineages. We find that all demographic events occurred during or after the Upper Pliocene and suggest that green anole diversification was driven by population divergence on interglacial island refugia in Florida during the Lower Pleistocene, while the region was often separated from continental North America. When Florida reconnected to the mainland, two separate dispersal events led to the expansion of green anole populations across the Atlantic Seaboard and Gulf Coastal Plain.},

	Abstract = {Anolis lizards are an emerging model system for the study of limb development and evolution, but very little is known concerning the regulatory interactions that control limb patterning differences among Anolis species or what regulatory interactions are deeply conserved between Anolis and other tetrapod groups. Here we report the establishment of an embryonic limb micromass culture system that enables functional studies of forelimb and hindlimb gene regulatory networks in Anolis. Characterization of this culture system demonstrated that embryonic forelimb and hindlimb micromasses from different Anolis species are easy to sustain in culture for weeks, and the expression of forelimb and hindlimb-specific gene expression patterns are maintained for at least 8 days in culture. We tested the ability of this system to explore regulatory linkages between transcription factors and their putative target genes through the ectopic expression of a hindlimb-specific transcription factor, pitx1, in forelimb micromasses. We found that pitx1 expression in forelimb cells is sufficient to strongly induce the expression of hoxc11, a gene that normally exhibits hindlimb-restricted expression.},

	Abstract = {Developmental genetic studies of vertebrates have focused primarily on zebrafish, frog and mouse models, which have clear application to medicine and well-developed genomic resources. In contrast, reptiles represent the most diverse amniote group, but have only recently begun to gather the attention of genome sequencing efforts. Extant reptilian groups last shared a common ancestor ?280 million years ago and include lepidosaurs, turtles and crocodilians. This phylogenetic diversity is reflected in great morphological and behavioral diversity capturing the attention of biologists interested in mechanisms regulating developmental processes such as somitogenesis and spinal patterning, regeneration, the evolution of "snake-like" morphology, the formation of the unique turtle shell, and the convergent evolution of the four-chambered heart shared by mammals and archosaurs. The complete genome of the first non-avian reptile, the green anole lizard, was published in 2011 and has provided insights into the origin and evolution of amniotes. Since then, the genomes of multiple snakes, turtles, and crocodilians have also been completed. Here we will review the current diversity of available reptile genomes, with an emphasis on their evolutionary relationships, and will highlight how these genomes have and will continue to facilitate research in developmental and regenerative biology.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of AID/APOBEC proteins in the mammalian immune response against retroviruses and retrotransposons is well established. G to A hypermutations, the hallmark of their cytidine deaminase activity, are present in several mammalian retrotransposons. However, the role of AID/APOBEC proteins in non-mammalian retroelement restriction is not completely understood. RESULTS: Here we provide the first evidence of anti-retroelement activity of a reptilian APOBEC protein. The green anole lizard A1 protein displayed potent DNA mutator activity and inhibited ex vivo retrotransposition of LINE1 and LINE2 ORF1 protein encoding elements, displaying a mechanism of action similar to that of the human A1 protein. In contrast, the human A3 proteins did not require ORF1 protein to inhibit LINE retrotransposition, suggesting a differential mechanism of anti-LINE action of A1 proteins, which emerged in amniotes, and A3 proteins, exclusive to placental mammals. In accordance, genomic analyses demonstrate differential G to A DNA editing of LINE retrotransposons in the lizard genome, which is also the first evidence for G to A DNA editing in non-mammalian genomes. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that vertebrate APOBEC proteins differentially inhibit the retrotransposition of LINE elements and that the anti-retroelement activity of APOBEC proteins predates mammals.},

	Abstract = {To explain the frequency and distribution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in the lizard genus Anolis, we compared the relative roles of sex chromosome conservation versus turnover of sex-determining mechanisms. We used model-based comparative methods to reconstruct karyotype evolution and the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes onto a newly generated Anolis phylogeny. We found that heteromorphic sex chromosomes evolved multiple times in the genus. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of repetitive DNA showed variable rates of Y chromosome degeneration among Anolis species and identified previously undetected, homomorphic sex chromosomes in two species. We confirmed homology of sex chromosomes in the genus by performing FISH of an X-linked bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and quantitative PCR of X-linked genes in multiple Anolis species sampled across the phylogeny. Taken together, these results are consistent with long-term conservation of sex chromosomes in the group. Our results pave the way to address additional questions related to Anolis sex chromosome evolution and describe a conceptual framework that can be used to evaluate the origins and evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes in other clades.},

	Abstract = {The phylogenetic position of turtles within the vertebrate tree of life remains controversial. Conflicting conclusions from different studies are likely a consequence of systematic error in the tree construction process, rather than random error from small amounts of data. Using genomic data, we evaluate the phylogenetic position of turtles with both conventional concatenated data analysis and a "genes as characters" approach. Two datasets were constructed, one with seven species (human, opossum, zebra finch, chicken, green anole, Chinese pond turtle, and western clawed frog) and 4584 orthologous genes, and the second with four additional species (soft-shelled turtle, Nile crocodile, royal python, and tuatara) but only 1638 genes. Our concatenated data analysis strongly supported turtle as the sister-group to archosaurs (the archosaur hypothesis), similar to several recent genomic data based studies using similar methods. When using genes as characters and gene trees as character-state trees with equal weighting for each gene, however, our parsimony analysis suggested that turtles are possibly sister-group to diapsids, archosaurs, or lepidosaurs. None of these resolutions were strongly supported by bootstraps. Furthermore, our incongruence analysis clearly demonstrated that there is a large amount of inconsistency among genes and most of the conflict relates to the placement of turtles. We conclude that the uncertain placement of turtles is a reflection of the true state of nature. Concatenated data analysis of large and heterogeneous datasets likely suffers from systematic error and over-estimates of confidence as a consequence of a large number of characters. Using genes as characters offers an alternative for phylogenomic analysis. It has potential to reduce systematic error, such as data heterogeneity and long-branch attraction, and it can also avoid problems associated with computation time and model selection. Finally, treating genes as characters provides a convenient method for examining gene and genome evolution.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the presence of Salmonella in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), an invasive alien species on Chichi Island, Japan. Samples were also collected from feral goats and public toilets on the island to examine infectious routes. Salmonellae were isolated from 27.1% of 199 samples; 32.6% of 141 cloacal samples from anoles, 62.5% of 8 intestinal samples from anole carcasses, 16.7% of 12 fecal samples from goats and 2.6% of 38 toilet bowl swabs. The serotype of most isolates was Salmonella Oranienburg (94.4% of 54). Although we did not confirm the infection pathways, our results indicated that green anoles are a risk factor as a source of Salmonella for public health. It is important to consider endemic pathogens that may be amplified by alien species within their introduced areas.},

	Abstract = {Lizards that undergo caudal autotomy experience a variety of consequences, including decreased locomotor performance in a number of cases. One mode of locomotion common to many arboreal lizard species is jumping, and yet little is known about the effects of autotomy on this locomotor mode. In this article we review recent literature demonstrating the importance of the lizard tail as an in-air stabilizer. First, we review work highlighting how a variety of lizards from diverse families can use their tails to control body position in midair. We then move on to cover recent work demonstrating how in at least one species, Anolis carolinensis, tail loss can lead to remarkable instabilities after takeoff during jumping. Such instabilities occur even when animals are jumping toward specific targets both below and above them, although individual variation in the response to tail loss is considerable. Finally, we report results from a study examining whether increased jumping experience after autotomy facilitates the recovery of in-air stability during jumping. Our work suggests it does not, at least not consistently after 5 wk, indicating that any fitness consequences associated with decreased jumping stability are likely to be long term.},

	Abstract = {The evolutionary processes that produce adaptive radiations are enigmatic. They can only be studied after the fact, once a radiation has occurred and been recognized, rather than while the processes are ongoing. One way to connect pattern to process is to study the processes driving divergence today among populations of species that belong to an adaptive radiation, and compare the results to patterns observed at a deeper, macroevolutionary level. We tested whether evolution is a deterministic process with similar outcomes during different stages of the adaptive radiation of Anolis lizards. Using a clade of terrestrial-scansorial lizards in the genus Anolis, we inferred the adaptive basis of spatial variation among contemporary populations and tested whether axes of phenotypic differentiation among them mirror known axes of diversification at deeper levels of the anole radiation. Nonparallel change associated with genetic divergence explains the vast majority of geographic variation. However, we found phenotypic variation to be adaptive as confirmed by convergence in populations occurring in similar habitats in different mountain ranges. Morphological diversification among populations recurs deterministically along two axes of diversification previously identified in the anole radiation, but the characters involved differ from those involved in adaptation at higher levels of anole phylogeny.},

	Abstract = {Linking variation in quantitative traits to variation in the genome is an important, but challenging task in the study of life-history evolution. Linkage maps provide a valuable tool for the unravelling of such trait-gene associations. Moreover, they give insight into recombination landscapes and between-species karyotype evolution. Here we used genotype data, generated from a 10k single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip, of over 2000 individuals to produce high-density linkage maps of the great tit (Parus major), a passerine bird that serves as a model species for ecological and evolutionary questions. We created independent maps from two distinct populations: a captive F2-cross from The Netherlands (NL) and a wild population from the United Kingdom (UK). The two maps contained 6554 SNPs in 32 linkage groups, spanning 2010 cM and 1917 cM for the NL and UK populations, respectively, and were similar in size and marker order. Subtle levels of heterochiasmy within and between chromosomes were remarkably consistent between the populations, suggesting that the local departures from sex-equal recombination rates have evolved. This key and surprising result would have been impossible to detect if only one population was mapped. A comparison with zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, chicken Gallus gallus and the green anole lizard Anolis carolinensis genomes provided further insight into the evolution of avian karyotypes.},

	Abstract = {The presence and localization of cathelicidin anti-microbial peptides in the lizard, Anolis carolinensis, were investigated by immunocytochemistry. The study showed that immunoreactivity for cathelicidins 1 and 2 was only present in large granules of heterophilic-basophilic granulocytes, rarely found in the dermis and sub-dermal muscle in normal and more frequently in wound and regenerating skin tissues or in the blood. Some immunopositive granulocytes were also observed among the keratinocytes of the wound epithelium covering the tail stump and occasionally in the regenerating epidermis of the tail. Immunolabeling for cathelicidins was also seen in low electrondense amorphous material present on the surface of the wound epidermis and on the plasma membrane of bacteria present on the surface of corneocytes of the epidermis. Immunolabeling for cathelicidins was absent in the other cell types and in control sections. The study suggests that cathelicidins are normally stored in granulocytes in the blood or in connective tissues, while keratinocytes can be stimulated to produce and possibly release these molecules only after injury or microbial invasion.},

	Abstract = {The diversity of sexual signals is astounding, and divergence in these traits is believed to be associated with the early stages of speciation. An increasing number of studies also suggest a role for natural selection in driving signal divergence for effective transmission in heterogeneous environments. Both speciation and adaptive divergence, however, are contingent on the sexual signal being heritable, yet this often remains assumed and untested. It is particularly critical that the heritability of carotenoid-based sexual signals is investigated because such traits may instead be phenotypically plastic indicators of an individual's quality that exhibit no or little heritable variation. We present the first study to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the striking diversity of dewlap color and pattern in Anolis lizards. Using a breeding experiment with Anolis distichus populations exhibiting different dewlap phenotypes, we raise F1 offspring in a common garden experiment to assess whether dewlap color is inherited. We follow this with carotenoid supplementation to investigate the influence of dietary pigments to dewlap color variation. We find significant differences in several aspects of dewlap color and pattern to persist to the F1 generation (fathers: N = 19; F1 males: N = 50; P < 0.01) with no change in dewlap phenotype with carotenoid supplementation (N = 52; P > 0.05). These results strongly support that genetic differences underlie dewlap color variation, thereby satisfying a key requirement of natural selection. Our findings provide an important stepping-stone to understanding the evolution of an incredibly diverse signal important for sexual selection and species recognition.},

	Abstract = {Ranaviral disease in amphibians has been studied intensely during the last decade, as associated mass-mortality events are considered to be a global threat to wild animal populations. Several studies have also included other susceptible ectothermic vertebrates (fish and reptiles), but only very few cases of ranavirus infections in lizards have been previously detected. In this study, we focused on clinically suspicious lizards and tested these animals for the presence of ranaviruses. Virological screening of samples from lizards with increased mortality and skin lesions over a course of four years led to the detection of ranaviral infections in seven different groups. Affected species were: brown anoles (Anolis sagrei), Asian glass lizards (Dopasia gracilis), green anoles (Anolis carolinensis), green iguanas (Iguana iguana), and a central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). Purulent to ulcerative-necrotizing dermatitis and hyperkeratosis were diagnosed in pathological examinations. All animals tested positive for the presence of ranavirus by PCR and a part of the major capsid protein (MCP) gene of each virus was sequenced. Three different ranaviruses were isolated in cell culture. The analyzed portions of the MCP gene from each of the five different viruses detected were distinct from one another and were 98.4-100% identical to the corresponding portion of the frog virus 3 (FV3) genome. This is the first description of ranavirus infections in these five lizard species. The similarity in the pathological lesions observed in these different cases indicates that ranaviral infection may be an important differential diagnosis for skin lesions in lizards.},

@article{Tollis:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Autonomous retrotransposons lacking long terminal repeats (LTR) account for much of the variation in genome size and structure among vertebrates. Mammalian genomes contain hundreds of thousands of non-LTR retrotransposon copies, mostly resulting from the amplification of a single clade known as L1. The genomes of teleost fish and squamate reptiles contain a much more diverse array of non-LTR retrotransposon families, whereas copy number is relatively low. The majority of non-LTR retrotransposon insertions in nonmammalian vertebrates also appear to be very recent, suggesting strong purifying selection limits the accumulation of non-LTR retrotransposon copies. It is however unclear whether this turnover model, originally proposed in Drosophila, applies to nonmammalian vertebrates. Here, we studied the population dynamics of L1 in the green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). We found that although most L1 elements are recent in this genome, truncated insertions accumulate readily, and many are fixed at both the population and species level. In contrast, full-length L1 insertions are found at lower population frequencies, suggesting that the turnover model only applies to longer L1 elements in Anolis. We also found that full-length L1 inserts are more likely to be fixed in populations of small effective size, suggesting that the strength of purifying selection against deleterious alleles is highly dependent on host demographic history. Similar mechanisms seem to be controlling the fate of non-LTR retrotransposons in both Anolis and teleostean fish, which suggests that mammals have considerably diverged from the ancestral vertebrate in terms of how they interact with their intragenomic parasites.},

@article{Jensen:2014aa,
	Abstract = {With approximately 7000 species, snakes and lizards, collectively known as squamates, are by far the most species-rich group of reptiles. It was from reptile-like ancestors that mammals and birds evolved and squamates can be viewed as phylogenetically positioned between them and fishes. Hence, their hearts have been studied for more than a century yielding insights into the group itself and into the independent evolution of the fully divided four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. Structurally the heart is complex and debates persist on rudimentary issues such as identifying structures critical to understanding ventricle function. In seeking to resolve these controversies we have generated three-dimensional (3D) models in portable digital format (pdf) of the anaconda and anole lizard hearts ('typical' squamate hearts) and the uniquely specialized python heart with comprehensive annotations of structures and cavities. We review the anatomy and physiology of squamate hearts in general and emphasize the unique features of pythonid and varanid lizard hearts that endow them with mammal-like blood pressures. Excluding pythons and varanid lizards it is concluded that the squamate heart has a highly consistent design including a disproportionately large right side (systemic venous) probably due to prevailing pulmonary bypass (intraventricular shunting). Unfortunately, investigations on rudimentary features are sparse. We therefore point out gaps in our knowledge, such as the size and functional importance of the coronary vasculature and of the first cardiac chamber, the sinus venosus, and highlight areas with implications for vertebrate cardiac evolution.},

	Abstract = {This article is part of a Special Issue "Puberty and Adolescence". Studies of birds and reptiles have provided many basic insights into the neuroendocrine control of reproductive processes. This research has elucidated mechanisms regulating both early development, including sexual differentiation, and adult neuroendocrine function and behavior. However, phenomena associated with the transition into sexual maturation (puberty) have not been a focus of investigators working on species in these taxonomic classes. Research is complicated in birds and reptiles by a variety of factors, including what can be extended times to maturation, the need to reach particular body size regardless of age, and environmental conditions that can support or inhibit endocrine responses. However, careful selection of model systems, particularly those with available genetic tools, will lead to important comparative studies that can elucidate both generalizability and diversity of mechanisms regulating the onset of reproductive maturity.},

	Abstract = {Parasites influence colorful ornaments and their behavioral display in many animal hosts. Because coloration and display behavior are often critical components of communication, variation in these traits may have important implications for individual fitness, yet it remains unclear whether such traits are signals of quality in many taxa. We investigated the association between ectoparasitic mite load and the color and behavioral use of the throat fan (dewlap) by male Anolis brevirostris lizards. We found that heavily parasitized lizards exhibited lower body condition, duller dewlaps, and less frequent dewlap displays than less parasitized individuals. Our results thus suggest that highly parasitized individuals invest less in both ornamental color and behavioral display of that color. Because the two components of the signal simultaneously provide information on male quality, this study provides novel support for the long-standing hypothesis that colorful traits may function as social or sexual signals in reptiles.},

	Abstract = {Variation in body characteristics related to lizard locomotion has been poorly studied at the intraspecific level in Anolis species. Local adaptation due to habitat heterogeneity has been reported in some island species. However, studies of mainland species are particularly scarce and suggest different patterns: high variability among highland lizards and poorly differentiated populations in one Amazonian species. We characterized inter population variation of body size and shape in the highland Andean Anolis ventrimaculatus, an endemic species from Western Colombia. A total of 15 morphometric variables were measured in specimens from the reptile collection of the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Nacional, Colombia. The study included individuals from seven different highland localities. We found size and shape sexual dimorphism, both of which varied among localities. Patterns of variation in body proportions among populations were different in both males and females, suggesting that either sexual or natural selective factors are different in each locality and between sexes. Since this species exhibits a fragmented distribution in highlands, genetic divergence may also be a causal factor of the observed variation. Ecological, behavioral, additional morphological as well as phylogenetic data, may help to understand the evolutionary processes behind the geographic patterns found in this species.},

	Abstract = {Green anoles are seasonally breeding lizards, with an annual rise in testosterone (T) being the primary activator of male sexual behaviors. Responsiveness to T is decreased in the non-breeding season (NBS) compared to breeding season (BS) on a variety of levels, including displays of reproductive behavior and the morphology and biochemistry of associated tissues. To evaluate the possibility that seasonal changes in responsiveness to T are regulated by androgen receptors (AR) and/or two of its coactivators, CREB binding protein (CBP) and steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), we tested whether they differ in expression across season in brains of both sexes and in peripheral copulatory tissues of males (hemipenis and retractor penis magnus muscle). AR mRNA was increased in the brains of males compared to females and in copulatory muscle in the BS compared to NBS. In the hemipenis, transcriptional activity appeared generally diminished in the NBS. T-treatment increased AR mRNA in the copulatory muscle and AR protein in the hemipenis, the latter to a greater extent in the BS than the NBS. T also decreased SRC-1 protein in hemipenis. Interpretations are complicated, in part because levels of mRNA and protein expression were not correlated and multiple sizes of the AR and CBP proteins were detected, with some tissue specificity. However, the results are consistent with the idea that differences in receptor and coactivator expression at central and peripheral levels may play roles in regulating sex and seasonal differences in the motivation or physical ability to engage in sexual behavior.},

	Abstract = {Studies integrating evolutionary and developmental analyses of morphological variation are of growing interest to biologists as they promise to shed fresh light on the mechanisms of morphological diversification. Sexually dimorphic traits tend to be incredibly divergent across taxa. Such diversification must arise through evolutionary modifications to sex differences during development. Nevertheless, few studies of dimorphism have attempted to synthesize evolutionary and developmental perspectives. Using geometric morphometric analysis of head shape for 50 Anolis species, we show that two clades have converged on extreme levels of sexual dimorphism through similar, male-specific changes in facial morphology. In both clades, males have evolved highly elongate faces whereas females retain faces of more moderate proportion. This convergence is accomplished using distinct developmental mechanisms; one clade evolved extreme dimorphism through the exaggeration of a widely shared, potentially ancestral, developmental strategy whereas the other clade evolved a novel developmental strategy not observed elsewhere in the genus. Together, our analyses indicate that both shared and derived features of development contribute to macroevolutionary patterns of morphological diversity among Anolis lizards.},

	Abstract = {Predation is one of the major selective agents influencing evolution of color patterns. Cryptic color patterns decrease detection probability by predators, but their concealing function depends on the background against which patterns are seen; therefore, habitat use and color patterns are tightly linked. In many anole species, females exhibit variation in dorsal color patterns; the drab and perhaps cryptic colors of the patterns suggest a predator avoidance function behind this polymorphism. We tested whether these different color patterns experience different predation rates depending on their microhabitat. We expected each pattern to form at least one optimal combination with a typically used micro-habitat that would result in lower predation compared to other morphs in the same micro-habitat. We tested this hypothesis for anoles at La Selva, Costa Rica, using clay models resembling a common species at this site: Norops humilis. The first experiment tested for variation in predation on various substrates. We included leaf litter, live leaves, and two size classes of woody stems, using 44 models for each pattern substrate combination. A second experiment tested effects of perch height (10 and 60cm) and diameter (< 2 cm and > 5 cm), with 50 models for each pattern perch combination. We found differences in predation rates between the morphs depending on their micro-habitat. Specifically, the striped morph had a significant advantage over the others on green leaves. In the second experiment, striped morphs showed significantly lower predation on low than on high perches, irrespective of perch diameter. Reticulated models had an advantage over other morphs on thin stems for the first experiment, where models were placed about 60cm high. Diameter did not have a significant effect on predation for reticulated morphs when height classes were combined. Dotted models did not experience an advantage over the other morphs in any of the treatments. In leaf litter and on thick perches no morph had any advantage over another, and leaf litter predation rates were generally low. These results support a role for predation in maintaining multiple female morphs within small Costa Rican anoles, such as N. humilis.},

	Abstract = {G. G. Simpson, one of the chief architects of evolutionary biology's modern synthesis, proposed that diversification occurs on a macroevolutionary adaptive landscape, but landscape models are seldom used to study adaptive divergence in large radiations. We show that for Caribbean Anolis lizards, diversification on similar Simpsonian landscapes leads to striking convergence of entire faunas on four islands. Parallel radiations unfolding at large temporal scales shed light on the process of adaptive diversification, indicating that the adaptive landscape may give rise to predictable evolutionary patterns in nature, that adaptive peaks may be stable over macroevolutionary time, and that available geographic area influences the ability of lineages to discover new adaptive peaks.},

@article{Guo:2013aa,
	Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial negative regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Next-generation sequencing technologies have identified a series of miRNA variants (named isomiRs). In this study, paralogous isomiR assemblies (from the miRNA locus) were systematically analyzed based on data acquired from deep sequencing data sets. Evolutionary analysis of paralogous (members in miRNA gene family in a specific species) and orthologues (across different animal species) miRNAs was also performed. The sequence diversity of paralogous isomiRs was found to be similar to the diversity of paralogous and orthologues miRNAs. Additionally, both isomiRs and paralogous/orthologues miRNAs were implicated in 5' and 3' ends (especially 3' ends), nucleotide substitutions, and insertions and deletions. Generally, multiple isomiRs can be produced from a single miRNA locus, but most of them had lower enrichment levels, and only several dominant isomiR sequences were detected. These dominant isomiR groups were always stable, and one of them would be selected as the most abundant miRNA sequence in specific animal species. Some isomiRs might be consistent to miRNA sequences in some species but not the other. Homologous miRNAs were often detected in similar isomiR repertoires, and showed similar expression patterns, while dominant isomiRs showed complex evolutionary patterns from miRNA sequences across the animal kingdom. These results indicate that the phenomenon of multiple isomiRs is not a random event, but rather the result of evolutionary pressures. The existence of multiple isomiRs enables different species to express advantageous sequences in different environments. Thus, dominant sequences emerge in response to functional and evolutionary pressures, allowing an organism to adapt to complex intra- and extra-cellular events.},

	Abstract = {In this study, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interferon gamma receptor (IFN-gammaR) genes have been identified in non-avian reptile, the North American green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). Like their counterparts from other jawed vertebrates, lizard IFN-gamma, IFN-gammaR1 and IFN-gammaR2 show conserved features in genomic organizations, gene loci and protein sequences. The IFN-gamma gene has the full cDNA sequence of 936 bp, with 522 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 174 amino acids, and has the genomic organization of four exons and three introns as observed in IFN-gamma genes of other classes of vertebrates. The receptors, IFN-gammaR1 and IFN-gammaR2 have the ORF of 1278 and 984 bp, coding for 425 and 327 aa, respectively, with the genome organization of seven exons and six introns. In the gene loci of IFN-gamma, DYRK2, IL22, IL26 and MDM1 are found with conserved synteny in vertebrates, and similar genes adjacent to IFN-gammaR1 and IFN-gammaR2 were also found. These receptors also contain conserved motifs, such as the membrane-proximal region and the C-terminal five residue motif in IFN-gammaR1, and intracellular conservative sequence in IFN-gammaR2, which have been confirmed to mediate down-stream JAK-STAT signaling pathway in mammals. IFN-gamma and its receptors, IFN-gammaR1 and IFN-gammaR2 were constitutively expressed in organs/tissues examined in the lizard, and up-regulated expression of IFN-gamma was observed in organs/tissues examined following the poly(I:C) stimulation, suggesting its antiviral role in lizards. The conserved features of IFN-gamma and its receptors, IFN-gammaR1 and IFN-gammaR2, in gene organization and gene locus as well as in functional domain or motif may imply that the function of type II IFN system is evolutionarily conserved in the green anole lizard, as observed in other classes of vertebrates.},

	Abstract = {Host specificity is one of the potential factors affecting parasite diversification because gene flow may be facilitated or constrained by the number of host species that a parasite can exploit. We test this hypothesis using a costructure approach, comparing two sympatric pinworm parasites that differ in host specificity - Parapharyngodon cubensis and Spauligodon anolis - on the Puerto Rican Bank and St. Croix in the Caribbean. Spauligodon anolis specializes on Anolis lizards, whereas P. cubensis parasitizes Anolis lizards as well as many other species of lizards and snakes. We collected lizards from across the Puerto Rican Bank and St. Croix, sampled them for S. anolis and P. cubensis and generated nuclear and mitochondrial sequence data from the parasites. We used these data to show that P. cubensis is comprised of multiple cryptic species that exhibit limited population structure relative to S. anolis, which is consistent with our prediction based on their host specificity. We also provide evidence that the distribution of P. cubensis species is maintained by competitive exclusion, and in contrast to previous theoretical work, the parasites with the greatest number of host species also reach the highest prevalence rates. Overall, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that host specificity shapes parasite diversification, and suggest that even moderate differences in host specificity may contribute to substantial differences in diversification.},

	Abstract = {Species-rich adaptive radiations typically diversify along several distinct ecological axes, each characterized by morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations. We test here whether different types of adaptive traits share similar patterns of evolution within a radiation by investigating patterns of evolution of morphological traits associated with microhabitat specialization and of physiological traits associated with thermal biology in Anolis lizards. Previous studies of anoles suggest that close relatives share the same "structural niche" (i.e., use the same types of perches) and are similar in body size and shape, but live in different "climatic niches" (i.e., use habitats with different insolation and temperature profiles). Because morphology is closely tied to structural niche and field active body temperatures are tied to climatic niches in Anolis, we expected phylogenetic analyses to show that morphology is more evolutionarily conservative than thermal physiology. In support of this hypothesis, we find (1) that thermal biology exhibits more divergence among recently diverged Anolis taxa than does morphology; and (2) diversification of thermal biology among all species often follows diversification in morphology. These conclusions are remarkably consistent with predictions made by anole biologists in the 1960s and 1970s.},

	Abstract = {Forecasts of the ecological impacts of climate change are generally focused on direct impacts to individual species. Theory and case studies suggest that indirect effects associated with species interactions may alter these direct responses. How can we tractably predict in which cases indirect effects are likely to be important and appropriately model the interaction of abiotic and biotic drivers? One viable strategy is to characterize partitioning between species along thermal, temporal, and spatial niche axes. The partitioning can be informed by assessing functional traits. Mechanistic models can then be applied to predict how climate change will alter niche partitioning. I illustrate this approach by asking whether competition has altered the responses of Caribbean Anolis lizards to recent warming and find that forested habitat has become more suitable for a warm-adapted, open species, and less suitable for a cool-adapted forest inhabitant. Competition may result in competitive displacement of the cool-adapted species as the warm-adapted species moves into the forest. Species interactions may accentuate abundance and distribution shifts predicted in response to climate change along the elevation gradient.},

@article{Park:2013aa,
	Abstract = {The glucagon (GCG) peptide family consists of GCG, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), and GLP2, which are derived from a common GCG precursor, and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). These peptides interact with cognate receptors, GCGR, GLP1R, GLP2R, and GIPR, which belong to the secretin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. We used bioinformatics to identify genes encoding a novel GCG-related peptide (GCRP) and its cognate receptor, GCRPR. The GCRP and GCRPR genes were found in representative tetrapod taxa such as anole lizard, chicken, and Xenopus, and in teleosts including medaka, fugu, tetraodon, and stickleback. However, they were not present in mammals and zebrafish. Phylogenetic and genome synteny analyses showed that GCRP emerged through two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R) during early vertebrate evolution. GCRPR appears to have arisen by local tandem gene duplications from a common ancestor of GCRPR, GCGR, and GLP2R after 2R. Biochemical ligand-receptor interaction analyses revealed that GCRP had the highest affinity for GCRPR in comparison to other GCGR family members. Stimulation of chicken, Xenopus, and medaka GCRPRs activated Galphas-mediated signaling. In contrast to chicken and Xenopus GCRPRs, medaka GCRPR also induced Galphaq/11-mediated signaling. Chimeric peptides and receptors showed that the K(16)M(17)K(18) and G(16)Q(17)A(18) motifs in GCRP and GLP1, respectively, may at least in part contribute to specific recognition of their cognate receptors through interaction with the receptor core domain. In conclusion, we present novel data demonstrating that GCRP and GCRPR evolved through gene/genome duplications followed by specific modifications that conferred selective recognition to this ligand-receptor pair.},

	Abstract = {Helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins play essential regulatory roles in a variety of biological processes. These highly conserved proteins form a large transcription factor superfamily, and are commonly identified in large numbers within animal, plant, and fungal genomes. The bHLH domain has been well studied in many animal species, but has not yet been characterized in non-avian reptiles. In this study, we identified 102 putative bHLH genes in the genome of the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis. Based on phylogenetic analysis, these genes were classified into 43 families, with 43, 24, 16, 3, 10, and 3 members assigned into groups A, B, C, D, E, and F, respectively, and 3 members categorized as "orphans". Within-group evolutionary relationships inferred from the phylogenetic analysis were consistent with highly conserved patterns observed for introns and additional domains. Results from phylogenetic analysis of the H/E(spl) family suggest that genome and tandem gene duplications have contributed to this family's expansion. Our classification and evolutionary analysis has provided insights into the evolutionary diversification of animal bHLH genes, and should aid future studies on bHLH protein regulation of key growth and developmental processes.},

	Abstract = {Birds and mammals both developed high performance hearts from a heart that must have been reptile-like and the hearts of extant reptiles have an unmatched variability in design. Yet, studies on cardiac development in reptiles are largely old and further studies are much needed as reptiles are starting to become used in molecular studies. We studied the growth of cardiac compartments and changes in morphology principally in the model organism corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus), but also in the genotyped anole (Anolis carolinenis and A. sagrei) and the Philippine sailfin lizard (Hydrosaurus pustulatus). Structures and chambers of the formed heart were traced back in development and annotated in interactive 3D pdfs. In the corn snake, we found that the ventricle and atria grow exponentially, whereas the myocardial volumes of the atrioventricular canal and the muscular outflow tract are stable. Ventricular development occurs, as in other amniotes, by an early growth at the outer curvature and later, and in parallel, by incorporation of the muscular outflow tract. With the exception of the late completion of the atrial septum, the adult design of the squamate heart is essentially reached halfway through development. This design strongly resembles the developing hearts of human, mouse and chicken around the time of initial ventricular septation. Subsequent to this stage, and in contrast to the squamates, hearts of endothermic vertebrates completely septate their ventricles, develop an insulating atrioventricular plane, shift and expand their atrioventricular canal toward the right and incorporate the systemic and pulmonary venous myocardium into the atria.},

	Abstract = {The archosauria consist of two living groups, crocodilians, and birds. Here we compare the structure, expression, and phylogeny of the beta (beta)-keratins in two crocodilian genomes and two avian genomes to gain a better understanding of the evolutionary origin of the feather beta-keratins. Unlike squamates such as the green anole with 40 beta-keratins in its genome, the chicken and zebra finch genomes have over 100 beta-keratin genes in their genomes, while the American alligator has 20 beta-keratin genes, and the saltwater crocodile has 21 beta-keratin genes. The crocodilian beta-keratins are similar to those of birds and these structural proteins have a central filament domain and N- and C-termini, which contribute to the matrix material between the twisted beta-sheets, which form the 2-3 nm filament. Overall the expression of alligator beta-keratin genes in the integument increases during development. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that a crocodilian beta-keratin clade forms a monophyletic group with the avian scale and feather beta-keratins, suggesting that avian scale and feather beta-keratins along with a subset of crocodilian beta-keratins evolved from a common ancestral gene/s. Overall, our analyses support the view that the epidermal appendages of basal archosaurs used a diverse array of beta-keratins, which evolved into crocodilian and avian specific clades. In birds, the scale and feather subfamilies appear to have evolved independently in the avian lineage from a subset of archosaurian claw beta-keratins. The expansion of the avian specific feather beta-keratin genes accompanied the diversification of birds and the evolution of feathers.},

	Abstract = {Geographic patterns in body size are often associated with latitude, elevation, or environmental and climatic variables. This study investigated patterns of body size and cell size of the green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, and potential associations with geography or climatic variables. Lizards were sampled from 19 populations across the native range, and body size, red blood cell size and size and number of muscle cells were measured. Climatic data from local weather stations and latitude and longitude were entered into model selection with Akaike's information criterion to explain patterns in cell and body sizes. Climatic variables did not drive any major patterns in cell size or body size; rather, latitude and longitude were the best predictors of cell and body size. In general, smaller body and cell sizes in Florida anoles drove geographic patterns in A. carolinensis. Small size in Florida may be attributable to the geological history of the peninsular state or the unique ecological factors in this area, including a recently introduced congener. In contrast to previous studies, we found that A. carolinensis does not follow Bergmann's rule when the influence of Florida is excluded. Rather, the opposite pattern of larger lizards in southern populations is evident in the absence of Florida populations, and mirrors the general pattern in squamates. Muscle cell size was negatively related to latitude and red blood cell size showed no latitudinal trend outside of Florida. Different patterns in the sizes of the 2 cell types confirm the importance of examining multiple cell types when studying geographic variation in cell size.},

	Abstract = {Reptiles, as the sister group to birds and mammals, are particularly valuable for comparative genomic studies among amniotes. The Australian central bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) is being developed as a reptilian model for such comparisons, with whole-genome sequencing near completion. The karyotype consists of 6 pairs of macrochromosomes and 10 pairs microchromosomes (2n = 32), including a female heterogametic ZW sex microchromosome pair. Here, we present a molecular cytogenetic map for P. vitticeps comprising 87 anchor bacterial artificial chromosome clones that together span each macro- and microchromosome. It is the first comprehensive cytogenetic map for any non-avian reptile. We identified an active nucleolus organizer region (NOR) on the sub-telomeric region of 2q by mapping 18S rDNA and Ag-NOR staining. We identified interstitial telomeric sequences in two microchromosome pairs and the W chromosome, indicating that microchromosome fusion has been a mechanism of karyotypic evolution in Australian agamids within the last 21 to 19 million years. Orthology searches against the chicken genome revealed an intrachromosomal rearrangement of P. vitticeps 1q, identified regions orthologous to chicken Z on P. vitticeps 2q, snake Z on P. vitticeps 6q and the autosomal microchromosome pair in P. vitticeps orthologous to turtle Pelodiscus sinensis ZW and lizard Anolis carolinensis XY. This cytogenetic map will be a valuable reference tool for future gene mapping studies and will provide the framework for the work currently underway to physically anchor genome sequences to chromosomes for this model Australian squamate.},

@article{Bieser:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Many reptiles, including the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), possess a temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) mechanism where the temperature at which the developing embryos are incubated dictates the gonadal sex of the animal. A number of mammalian gene orthologues have been identified in the sex determination/differentiation cascade of reptiles with TSD although the exact trigger(s) is not well understood. A potential early regulator of gonadal differentiation, Lhx9, controls the proliferation of gonadal cells in mice and its absence prevents gonadal development and drastically reduces the expression of Sf-1, a gene that regulates the expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the bipotential gonad. In the current study, we cloned Lhx9 from T. scripta and analyzed its expression throughout the thermosensitive period of gonad development using quantitative PCR. We examined the expression profiles of Lhx9 in embryos incubated under control conditions at male- and female-producing temperatures and with the application of exogenous 17beta-estradiol or an aromatase inhibitor, Letrozole, to induce sex reversal. The T. scripta Lhx9 cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence showed high homology to those of chicken, anole, and mouse. Lhx9 was expressed at both male- and female-producing temperatures with expression levels increasing throughout the thermosensitive period. Letrozole induced sex-reversal did not alter Lhx9 expression levels. 17beta-estradiol treatments appeared to inhibit or delay gonadal differentiation and resulted in lower Lhx9 expression from the presumptive gonadal ridge region. The structural homology and temporal expression pattern of Lhx9 suggests that this represents a conserved element in the gonadal differentiation cascade of T. scripta.},

We investigated the pattern and possible mechanism of introgression between two sister species from Puerto Rico, Anolis pulchellus and Anolis krugi, using mitochondrial (ND2) and nuclear (DNAH3, NKTR) DNA sequences. Our findings demonstrated extensive introgression of A. krugi mtDNA (k-mtDNA) into the genome of A. pulchellus in western Puerto Rico, to the extent that k-mtDNA has mostly or completely replaced the native mtDNA of A. pulchellus on this part of the island. We proposed two not mutually exclusive scenarios to account for the interspecific matings between A. pulchellus and A. krugi. We inferred that hybridization events occurred independently in several populations, and determined that k-mtDNA haplotypes harboured in individuals of A. pulchellus can be assigned to four of the five major mtDNA clades of A. krugi. Further, the spatial distribution of k-mtDNA clades in the two species is largely congruent. Based on this evidence, we concluded that natural selection was the probable driving mechanism for the extensive k-mtDNA introgression into A. pulchellus. Our two nuclear data sets yielded different results. DNAH3 showed reciprocal monophyly of A. pulchellus and A. krugi, indicating no effect of hybridization on this marker. In contrast, the two species shared nine NKTR alleles, probably due to incomplete lineage sorting. Our study system will provide an excellent opportunity to experimentally assess the behavioural and ecological mechanisms that can lead to hybridization in closely related taxa.},

	Abstract = {Much attention has been given to recent predictions that widespread extinctions of tropical ectotherms, and tropical forest lizards in particular, will result from anthropogenic climate change. Most of these predictions, however, are based on environmental temperature data measured at a maximum resolution of 1 km(2), whereas individuals of most species experience thermal variation on a much finer scale. To address this disconnect, we combined thermal performance curves for five populations of Anolis lizard from the Bay Islands of Honduras with high-resolution temperature distributions generated from physical models. Previous research has suggested that open-habitat species are likely to invade forest habitat and drive forest species to extinction. We test this hypothesis, and compare the vulnerabilities of closely related, but allopatric, forest species. Our data suggest that the open-habitat populations we studied will not invade forest habitat and may actually benefit from predicted warming for many decades. Conversely, one of the forest species we studied should experience reduced activity time as a result of warming, while two others are unlikely to experience a significant decline in performance. Our results suggest that global-scale predictions generated using low-resolution temperature data may overestimate the vulnerability of many tropical ectotherms to climate change.},

	Abstract = {The tetrapods are a diverse assemblage of vertebrates, and that diversity is reflected in the sequences of tetrapod melanocortin-2 receptors (MC2Rs). In this review, the features common to human (mammal), Gallus gallus (bird), Anolis carolinensis (reptile), and Xenopus tropicalis (amphibian) MC2Rs in terms of ligand selectivity, requirements for interaction with MRAP1, and the effects of alanine substitutions to three amino acid motifs in the ligand hACTH(1-24) are discussed. Analysis of the effects of alanine substitutions to the H(6)F(7)R(8)W(9) and the K(15)K(16)R(17)R(18)P(19) motifs of hACTH(1-24) indicated that activation of A. carolinensis MC2R and X. tropicalis MC2R was more adversely affected by alanine substitutions at these positions as compared to the response of human MC2R to these same analogs. Furthermore, single alanine substitutions in the G(10)K(11)P(12)V(13)G(14) motif of hACTH(1-24) had negative affects on activation of both A. carolinensis MC2R and X. tropicalis MC2R that were not observed for human MC2R. The implications of responses to the various analogs of hACTH(1-24) in terms of the mechanism for mediating the activation of these various tetrapod melanocortin-2 receptors are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive divergence in coloration is expected to produce reproductive isolation in species that use colourful signals in mate choice and species recognition. Indeed, many adaptive radiations are characterized by differentiation in colourful signals, suggesting that divergent selection acting on coloration may be an important component of speciation. Populations in the Anolis marmoratus species complex from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe display striking divergence in the colour and pattern of adult males that occurs over small geographic distances, suggesting strong divergent selection. Here we test the hypothesis that divergence in coloration results in reduced gene flow among populations. We quantify variation in adult male coloration across a habitat gradient between mesic and xeric habitats, use a multilocus coalescent approach to infer historical demographic parameters of divergence, and examine gene flow and population structure using microsatellite variation. We find that colour variation evolved without geographic isolation and in the face of gene flow, consistent with strong divergent selection and that both ecological and sexual selection are implicated. However, we find no significant differentiation at microsatellite loci across populations, suggesting little reproductive isolation and high levels of contemporary gene exchange. Strong divergent selection on loci affecting coloration probably maintains clinal phenotypic variation despite high gene flow at neutral loci, supporting the notion of a porous genome in which adaptive portions of the genome remain fixed whereas neutral portions are homogenized by gene flow and recombination. We discuss the impact of these findings for studies of colour evolution and ecological speciation.},

	Abstract = {Adenovirus infection has emerged as a serious threat to the health of captive snakes and lizards (i.e., squamates), but we know relatively little about this virus' range of possible hosts, pathogenicity, modes of transmission, and sources from nature. We report the first case of adenovirus infection in the Iguanidae, a diverse family of lizards that is widely-studied and popular in captivity. We report adenovirus infections from two closely-related species of Anolis lizards (anoles) that were recently imported from wild populations in the Dominican Republic to a laboratory colony in the United States. We investigate the evolution of adenoviruses in anoles and other squamates using phylogenetic analyses of adenovirus polymerase gene sequences sampled from Anolis and a range of other vertebrate taxa. These phylogenetic analyses reveal that (1) the sequences detected from each species of Anolis are novel, and (2) adenoviruses are not necessarily host-specific and do not always follow a co-speciation model under which host and virus phylogenies are perfectly concordant. Together with the fact that the Anolis adenovirus sequences reported in our study were detected in animals that became ill and subsequently died shortly after importation while exhibiting clinical signs consistent with acute adenovirus infection, our discoveries suggest the need for renewed attention to biosecurity measures intended to prevent the spread of adenovirus both within and among species of snakes and lizards housed in captivity.},

	Abstract = {Effectively moving across variable substrates is important to all terrestrial animals. The effects of substrates on lizard performance have ecological ramifications including the partitioning of habitat according to sprinting ability on different surfaces. This phenomenon is known as sprint sensitivity, or the decrease in sprint speed due to change in substrate. However, sprint sensitivity has been characterized only in arboreal Anolis lizards. Our study measured sensitivity to substrate rugosity among six lizard species that occupy rocky, sandy, and/or arboreal habitats. Lizards that use rocky habitats are less sensitive to changes in substrate rugosity, followed by arboreal lizards, and then by lizards that use sandy habitats. We infer from comparative phylogenetic analysis that forelimb, chest, and tail dimensions are important external morphological features related to sensitivity to changes in substrate rugosity.},

	Abstract = {The ability of lizards to withstand infections after wounding or amputation of the tail or limbs has suggested the presence of antimicrobial peptides in their tissues. Previous studies on the lizard Anolis carolinensis have identified several beta-defensin-like peptides that may potentially be involved in protection from infections. The present ultrastructural immunocytochemical study has analyzed tissues in different reptilian species in order to localize the cellular source of one of the more expressed beta-defensins previously sequenced in lizard indicated as AcBD15. Beta-defensin-like immunoreactivity is present in some of the larger, nonspecific granules of granulocytes in two lizard species, a snake, the tuatara, and a turtle. The ultrastructural study indicates that only heterophilic and basophilic granulocytes contain this defensin while other cell types from the epidermis, mesenchyme, and dermis, muscles, nerves, cartilage or bone are immunonegative. The study further indicates that not all granules in reptilian granulocytes contain the beta-defensin peptide, suggesting the presence of granules with different content as previously indicated for mammalian neutrophilic leucocytes. No immunolabeling was instead observed in granulocytes of the alligator and chick using this antibody. The present immunocytochemical observations suggest a broad cross-reactivity and conservation of beta-defensin-like sequence or steric motif across lepidosaurians and likely in turtles while archosaurian granulocytes may contain different beta-defensin-like or other peptides.},

@article{Lambert:2013aa,
	Abstract = {The pattern of reproductive character displacement (RCD)-in which traits associated with reproductive isolation are more different where two species occur together than where they occur in isolation-is frequently attributed to reinforcement, a process during which natural selection acting against maladaptive mating events leads to enhanced prezygotic isolation between species or incipient species. One of the first studies of RCD to include molecular genetic data was described 40 years ago in a complex of Haitian trunk anole lizards using a small number of allozyme loci. In this example, Anolis caudalis appears to experience divergence in the color and pattern of an extensible throat fan, or dewlap, in areas of contact with closely related species at the northern and southern limits of its range. However, this case study has been largely overlooked for decades; meanwhile, explanations for geographic variation in dewlap color and pattern have focused primarily on adaptation to local signalling environments. We reinvestigate this example using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genome scans, mtDNA sequence data, information on dewlap phenotypes and GIS data on environmental variation to test the hypothesis of RCD generated by reinforcement in Haitian trunk anoles. Together, our phenotypic and genetic results are consistent with RCD at the southern and northern limits of the range of A. caudalis. We evaluate the evidence for reinforcement as the explanation for RCD in Haitian trunk anoles, consider alternative explanations and provide suggestions for future work on the relationship between dewlap variation and speciation in Haitian trunk anoles.},

	Abstract = {Reptiles are one of the most ecologically and evolutionarily remarkable groups of living organisms, having successfully colonized most of the planet, including the oceans and some of the harshest and more environmentally unstable ecosystems on earth. Here, based on a complete dataset of all the world's diversity of living reptiles, we analyse lineage taxonomic richness both within and among clades, at different levels of the phylogenetic hierarchy. We also analyse the historical tendencies in the descriptions of new reptile species from Linnaeus to March 2012. Although (non-avian) reptiles are the second most species-rich group of amniotes after birds, most of their diversity (96.3%) is concentrated in squamates (59% lizards, 35% snakes, and 2% amphisbaenians). In strong contrast, turtles (3.4%), crocodilians (0.3%), and tuataras (0.01%) are far less diverse. In terms of species discoveries, most turtles and crocodilians were described early, while descriptions of lizards, snakes and amphisbaenians are multimodal with respect to time. Lizard descriptions, in particular, have reached unprecedented levels during the last decade. Finally, despite such remarkably asymmetric distributions of reptile taxonomic diversity among groups, we found that the distributions of lineage richness are consistently right-skewed, with most clades (monophyletic families and genera) containing few lineages (monophyletic genera and species, respectively), while only a few have radiated greatly (notably the families Colubridae and Scincidae, and the lizard genera Anolis and Liolaemus). Therefore, such consistency in the frequency distribution of richness among clades and among phylogenetic levels suggests that the nature of reptile biodiversity is fundamentally fractal (i.e., it is scale invariant). We then compared current reptile diversity with the global reptile diversity and taxonomy known in 1980. Despite substantial differences in the taxonomies (relative to 2012), the patterns of lineage richness remain qualitatively identical, hence reinforcing our conclusions about the fractal nature of reptile biodiversity.},

	Abstract = {Uncovering the genetic and developmental changes that generate morphological diversity is one of the longstanding challenges in biology. The developmental process generating the spine, one of the defining features of vertebrates, constitutes one of these core questions. The vertebral column is patterned in early development through the formation of segments, called somites, regulated by gene networks collectively called the segmentation clock. While previous studies of somite development in amniotes have focused almost exclusively on the mouse and chick model systems, the growing availability of genomic sequences in other taxa has opened up the possibility of comparative developmental studies in nontraditional reptilian models, such as the anole lizard, alligator, and snake. These studies have identified conserved features of the segmentation clock, but they have also challenged previous assumptions and identified divergence in the genetic networks. Ongoing work will help to elucidate which of these morphological changes may be explained by divergences in development in amniote evolution.},

	Abstract = {Although abiotic and biotic factors can interact to shape the spatial niche of a species, studies that explore the interactive effects of both at a local scale are rare. We demonstrate that one of the main axes (perch height) characterizing the spatial niche of a common lizard, Anolis sagrei, varies according to the interactive effects of weather and the activity of a larger predatory lizard, Leiocephalus carinatus. Results were completely consistent: no matter how favorable the weather conditions for using the ground (mainly characterized by temperature, humidity, wind speed, rain), A. sagrei did not do so if the predator was present. Hence, great behavioral plasticity enabled A. sagrei to adjust its use of space very quickly. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first field demonstration for anoles (and possibly for other animals as well) of how time-varying environmental conditions and predator presence interact to produce short-term changes in utilization along a major niche axis.},

	Abstract = {The epidermis of digital pads in geckos comprises superficial microornamentation from the oberhautchen layer that form long setae allowing these lizards to climb vertical surfaces. The beta-layer is reduced in pad lamellae but persists up to the apical free margin. Setae are made of different proteins including keratin-associated beta-proteins, formerly indicated as beta-keratins. In order to identify specific setal proteins the present ultrastructural study on geckos pad lamellae analyzes the immunolocalization of three beta-proteins previously found in the epidermis and adhesive setae of the green anolis. A protein rich in glycine but poor in cysteine (HgG5-like) is absent or masked in gecko pad lamellae. Another protein rich in glycine and cysteine (HgGC3-like) is weakly present in setae, oberhautchen and beta-layer. A glycine and cysteine medium rich beta-protein (HgGC10-like) is present in the lower part of the beta-layer but is absent in the oberhautchen, setae, and mesos layer. The latter two proteins may form intermolecular bonds that contribute to the flexibility of the corneous material sustaining the setae. The pliable alpha-layer present beneath the thin beta-layer and in the hinge region of the pad lamellae also contains HgGC10-like proteins. Based on the possibility that some HgGC3-like or other cys-rich beta-proteins are charged in the setae it is suggested that their charges influence the mechanism of adhesion increasing the induction of dipoles on the substrate and enhancing attractive van der Waals forces.},

	Abstract = {Although the importance of signals involved in species recognition and sexual selection to speciation is widely recognized, the processes that underlie signal divergence are still a matter of debate. Several possible processes have been hypothesized, including genetic drift, arbitrary sexual selection, and adaptation to local signaling environments. We use comparative analyses to investigate whether the remarkable geographic variation of dewlap phenotype in a Hispaniolan trunk Anolis lizard (A. distichus) is a result of adaptive signal divergence to heterogeneous environments. We recover a repeated pattern of divergence in A. distichus dewlap color, pattern, and size with environmental variation across Hispaniola. These results are aligned with ecological models of signal divergence and provide strong evidence for dewlap adaptation to local signaling environments. We also find that A. distichus dewlaps vary with the environment in a different manner to other previously studied anoles, thus expanding upon previous predictions on the direction dewlaps will diverge in perceptual color space in response to the environment.},

@article{Eckalbar:2013aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The green anole lizard, Anolis carolinensis, is a key species for both laboratory and field-based studies of evolutionary genetics, development, neurobiology, physiology, behavior, and ecology. As the first non-avian reptilian genome sequenced, A. carolinesis is also a prime reptilian model for comparison with other vertebrate genomes. The public databases of Ensembl and NCBI have provided a first generation gene annotation of the anole genome that relies primarily on sequence conservation with related species. A second generation annotation based on tissue-specific transcriptomes would provide a valuable resource for molecular studies. RESULTS: Here we provide an annotation of the A. carolinensis genome based on de novo assembly of deep transcriptomes of 14 adult and embryonic tissues. This revised annotation describes 59,373 transcripts, compared to 16,533 and 18,939 currently for Ensembl and NCBI, and 22,962 predicted protein-coding genes. A key improvement in this revised annotation is coverage of untranslated region (UTR) sequences, with 79% and 59% of transcripts containing 5' and 3' UTRs, respectively. Gaps in genome sequence from the current A. carolinensis build (Anocar2.0) are highlighted by our identification of 16,542 unmapped transcripts, representing 6,695 orthologues, with less than 70% genomic coverage. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of tissue-specific transcriptome sequence into the A. carolinensis genome annotation has markedly improved its utility for comparative and functional studies. Increased UTR coverage allows for more accurate predicted protein sequence and regulatory analysis. This revised annotation also provides an atlas of gene expression specific to adult and embryonic tissues.},

The former species is widely distributed in the islands, whereas the latter species is found from a single island only, Anijima Island. Although this island appears to be currently well preserved, the recent introduction of green anoles will probably affect the conservation status of many species, including the endemic P. anijimensis sp. nov.

	Abstract = {Emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) are farmed for their oil for pharmaceutical and cosmetic uses. This emu pituitary expressed sequence tag study was undertaken to identify novel transcripts in the emu pituitary to propel their identification and functional studies. By mapping reads derived from the Roche 454 GS Junior pyrosequencer to 8 reference species (human, mouse, chicken, zebra finch, fruit fly, turkey, round worm, and Carolina anole lizard) from the UniGene database, a total of 81,788 reads (53,312 mapped reads) were obtained and assembled with Reference Sequence (RefSeq). We annotated 6,676 potential emu genes by referencing 7 species (excluding lizard) and identified 1,232 potential genes common among 3 species (human, mouse, and chicken) with complete available reference genomes. Gene Ontology analysis revealed 376 Gene Ontology terms showing, with the highest counts, their involvements in biological processes, metabolism, and cellular components. These potential genes were detected to associate with 20 pathways including mitogen-activated protein kinase, insulin, neurotrophin signaling pathways, and carbohydrate digestion and absorption pathway. We also revealed a panel of tissue-specific genes including regulator of G-protein signaling protein (RGS), glucagon-like peptide receptor (GLPR), and growth hormone-inducible transmembrane protein (GHITM). Additionally, fatty acid binding protein (FABP), fatty acid desaturase (FAS), and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD), key enzyme genes in fat metabolism, were found to be also expressed in emu pituitary. This expressed sequence tag study represents the first step in functional characterization of emu pituitary gene expression and SNP identification for the improvement of fat production in the emu.},

	Abstract = {Activity within the social behavior neural network is modulated by the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) and its mammalian homologue arginine vasopressin (AVP). However, central AVT/AVP release causes different behavioral effects across species and social environments. These differences may be due to the activation of different neuronal AVT/AVP populations or to similar activity patterns causing different behavioral outputs. We examined neural activity (assessed as Fos induction) within AVT neurons in male brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) participating in aggressive or sexual encounters. Lizards possess simple amniote nervous systems, and their examination provides a comparative framework to complement avian and mammalian studies. In accordance with findings in other species, AVT neurons in the anole paraventricular nucleus (PVN) were activated during aggressive encounters; but unlike in other species, a positive correlation was found between aggression levels and activation. Activation of AVT neurons within the supraoptic nucleus (SON) occurred nonspecifically with participation in either aggressive or sexual encounters. Activation of AVT neurons in the preoptic area (POA) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) was associated with engagement in sexual behaviors. The above findings are congruent with neural activation patterns observed in other species, even when the behavioral outputs (i.e., aggression level) differed. However, aggressive encounters also increased activation of AVT neurons in the BNST, which is incongruous with findings in other species. Thus, some species differences involve the encoding of social stimuli as different neural activation patterns within the AVT/AVP network, whereas other behavioral differences arise downstream of this system.},

@article{Sun:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Evolutionary changes in genome size result from the combined effects of mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Insertion and deletion mutations (indels) directly impact genome size by adding or removing sequences. Most species lose more DNA through small indels (i.e., ~1-30 bp) than they gain, which can result in genome reduction over time. Because this rate of DNA loss varies across species, small indel dynamics have been suggested to contribute to genome size evolution. Species with extremely large genomes provide interesting test cases for exploring the link between small indels and genome size; however, most large genomes remain relatively unexplored. Here, we examine rates of DNA loss in the tetrapods with the largest genomes-the salamanders. We used low-coverage genomic shotgun sequence data from four salamander species to examine patterns of insertion, deletion, and substitution in neutrally evolving non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon sequences. For comparison, we estimated genome-wide DNA loss rates in non-LTR retrotransposon sequences from five other vertebrate genomes: Anolis carolinensis, Danio rerio, Gallus gallus, Homo sapiens, and Xenopus tropicalis. Our results show that salamanders have significantly lower rates of DNA loss than do other vertebrates. More specifically, salamanders experience lower numbers of deletions relative to insertions, and both deletions and insertions are skewed toward smaller sizes. On the basis of these patterns, we conclude that slow DNA loss contributes to genomic gigantism in salamanders. We also identify candidate molecular mechanisms underlying these differences and suggest that natural variation in indel dynamics provides a unique opportunity to study the basis of genome stability.},

	Abstract = {The predominant view is that the thermal physiology of tropical ectotherms, including lizards, is not labile over ecological timescales. We used the recent introduction ( approximately 35 years ago) of the Puerto Rican lizard Anolis cristatellus to Miami, Florida, to test this thermal rigidity hypothesis. We measured lower (critical thermal minimum [CT(min)]) and upper (critical thermal maximum [CT(max)]) thermal tolerances and found that the introduced population tolerates significantly colder temperatures (by approximately 3 degrees C) than does the Puerto Rican source population; however, CT(max) did not differ. These results mirror the thermal regimes experienced by each population: Miami reaches colder ambient temperatures than Puerto Rico, but maximum ambient temperatures are similar. The differences in CT(min) were observed even though lizards from both sites experienced nearly identical conditions for 49 days before CT(min) measurement. Our results demonstrate that changes in thermal tolerance occurred relatively rapidly ( approximately 35 generations), which strongly suggests that the thermal physiology of tropical lizards is more labile than previously proposed.},

@article{Matsubara:2012aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extant sauropsids (reptiles and birds) are divided into two major lineages, the lineage of Testudines (turtles) and Archosauria (crocodilians and birds) and the lineage of Lepidosauria (tuatara, lizards, worm lizards and snakes). Karyotypes of these sauropsidan groups generally consist of macrochromosomes and microchromosomes. In chicken, microchromosomes exhibit a higher GC-content than macrochromosomes. To examine the pattern of intra-genomic GC heterogeneity in lepidosaurian genomes, we constructed a cytogenetic map of the Japanese four-striped rat snake (Elaphe quadrivirgata) with 183 cDNA clones by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and examined the correlation between the GC-content of exonic third codon positions (GC3) of the genes and the size of chromosomes on which the genes were localized. RESULTS: Although GC3 distribution of snake genes was relatively homogeneous compared with those of the other amniotes, microchromosomal genes showed significantly higher GC3 than macrochromosomal genes as in chicken. Our snake cytogenetic map also identified several conserved segments between the snake macrochromosomes and the chicken microchromosomes. Cross-species comparisons revealed that GC3 of most snake orthologs in such macrochromosomal segments were GC-poor (GC3 < 50%) whereas those of chicken orthologs in microchromosomes were relatively GC-rich (GC3 >/= 50%). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the chromosome size-dependent GC heterogeneity had already occurred before the lepidosaur-archosaur split, 275 million years ago. This character was probably present in the common ancestor of lepidosaurs and but lost in the lineage leading to Anolis during the diversification of lepidosaurs. We also identified several genes whose GC-content might have been influenced by the size of the chromosomes on which they were harbored over the course of sauropsid evolution.},

	Abstract = {Anolis carolinensis is an emerging model species and the sole member of its genus native to the United States. Considerable morphological and physiological variation has been described in the species, and the recent sequencing of its genome makes it an attractive system for studies of genome variation. To inform future studies of molecular and phenotypic variation within A. carolinensis, a rigorous account of intraspecific population structure and relatedness is needed. Here, we present the most extensive phylogeographic study of this species to date. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data support the previous hypothesis of a western Cuban origin of the species. We found five well-supported, geographically distinct mitochondrial haplotype clades throughout the southeastern United States. Most Florida populations fall into one of three divergent clades, whereas the vast majority of populations outside Florida belong to a single, shallowly diverged clade. Genetic boundaries do not correspond to major rivers, but may reflect effects of Pleistocene glaciation events and the Appalachian Mountains on migration and expansion of the species. Phylogeographic signal should be examined using nuclear loci to complement these findings.},

	Abstract = {Investigating the properties of ecological landscapes that influence gene flow among populations can provide key insights into the earliest stages of biological divergence. Both ecological and geographical factors can reduce gene flow, which can lead to population divergence, but we know little of the relative strengths of these phenomena in nature. Here, we use a novel application of structural equation modelling to quantify the contributions of ecological and geographical isolation to spatial genetic divergence in 17 species of Anolis lizards. Our comparative analysis shows that although both processes contributed significantly, geographical isolation explained substantially more genetic divergence than ecological isolation (36.3 vs. 17.9% of variance respectively), suggesting that despite the proposed ubiquity of ecological divergence, non-ecological factors play the dominant role in the evolution of spatial genetic divergence.},

@article{Walder:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Immunohistochemical studies previously revealed the presence of the peptide transmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) in spinal motor neurons, axons and presumptive neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). At synapses in the central nervous system, NAAG has been shown to activate the type 3 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR3) and is inactivated by an extracellular peptidase, glutamate carboxypeptidase II. The present study tested the hypothesis that NAAG meets the criteria for classification as a co-transmitter at the vertebrate NMJ. Confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of NAAG immunoreactivity and extended the resolution of the peptide's location in the lizard (Anolis carolinensis) NMJ. NAAG was localised to a presynaptic region immediately adjacent to postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors. NAAG was depleted by potassium-induced depolarisation and by electrical stimulation of motor axons. The NAAG receptor, mGluR3, was localised to the presynaptic terminal consistent with NAAG's demonstrated role as a regulator of synaptic release at central synapses. In contrast, glutamate receptors, type 2 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2) and N-methyl-d-aspartate, were closely associated with acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II, the NAAG-inactivating enzyme, was identified exclusively in perisynaptic glial cells. This localisation was confirmed by the loss of immunoreactivity when these cells were selectively eliminated. Finally, electrophysiological studies showed that exogenous NAAG inhibited evoked neurotransmitter release by activating a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2 or mGluR3). Collectively, these data support the conclusion that NAAG is a co-transmitter at the vertebrate NMJ.},

@article{Burns:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Sensory hair cell losses lead to hearing and balance deficits that are permanent for mammals, but temporary for nonmammals because supporting cells in their ears give rise to replacement hair cells. In mice and humans, vestibular supporting cells grow exceptionally large circumferential F-actin belts and their junctions express E-cadherin in patterns that strongly correlate with postnatal declines in regeneration capacity. In contrast, chicken supporting cells retain thin F-actin belts throughout life and express little E-cadherin. To determine whether the junctions in chicken ears might be representative of other ears that also regenerate hair cells, we investigated inner ears from dogfish sharks, zebrafish, bullfrogs, Xenopus, turtles, and the lizard, Anolis. As in chickens, the supporting cells in adult zebrafish, Xenopus, and turtle ears retained thin circumferential F-actin belts and expressed little E-cadherin. Supporting cells in adult sharks and bullfrogs also retained thin belts, but were not tested for E-cadherin. Supporting cells in adult Anolis exhibited wide, but porous webs of F-actin and strong E-cadherin expression. Anolis supporting cells also showed some cell cycle reentry when cultured. The results reveal that the association between thin F-actin belts and low E-cadherin is shared by supporting cells in anamniotes, turtles, and birds, which all can regenerate hair cells. Divergent junctional specializations in supporting cells appear to have arisen independently in Anolis and mammals. The presence of webs of F-actin at the junctions in Anolis appears compatible with supporting cell proliferation, but the solid reinforcement of the F-actin belts in mammals is associated with its absence.},

@article{Alibardi:2013ad,
	Abstract = {The localization of specific keratin-associated beta-proteins (formerly referred to as beta-keratins) in the embryonic epidermis of lizards is not known. Two specific keratin-associated beta-proteins of the epidermis, one representing the glycine-rich subfamily (HgG5) and the other the glycine-cysteine medium-rich subfamily (HgGC10), have been immunolocalized at the ultrastructural level in the lizard Anolis lineatopus. The periderm and granulated subperiderm are most immunonegative for these proteins. HgG5 is low to absent in theOberhautchen layer while is present in the forming beta-layer, and disappears in mesos- and alpha-layers. Instead, HgGC10 is present in the Oberhautchen, beta-, and also in the following alpha-layers, and specifically accumulates in the developing adhesive setae but not in the surrounding cells of the clear layer. Therefore, setae and their terminal spatulae that adhere to surfaces allowing these lizards to walk vertically contain cysteine-glycine rich proteins. The study suggests that, like in adult and regenerating epidermis, the HgGC10 protein is not only accumulated in cells of the beta-layer but also in those forming the alpha-layer. This small protein therefore is implicated in resistance, flexibility, and stretching of the epidermal layers. It is also hypothesized that the charges of these proteins may influence adhesion of the setae of pad lamellae. Conversely, glycine-rich beta-proteins like HgG5 give rise to the dense, hydrophobic, and chromophobic corneous material of the resistant beta-layer. This result suggests that the differential accumulation of keratin-associated beta-proteins over the alpha-keratin network determines differences in properties of the stratified layers of the epidermis of lizards.},

	Abstract = {We investigate extensive quantitative trait variation (dewlap hue, colour pattern, dorsum hue, body proportions and scalation) in the Martinique anole across eight transects representing nascent parapatric ecological speciation, nascent allopatric speciation and allopatric divergence without sufficient genetic structure to suggest speciation. Quantitative trait divergence can be extremely large between adjacent sets of populations, but with one exception that this is associated with difference in habitat rather than past allopatry. Nascent ecological speciation shows the greatest level of quantitative trait divergence across all character sets including those implicated in natural, as well as sexual selection. The sole example of nascent allopatric speciation is associated with fairly strong quantitative trait divergence among most character sets, but not the set most implicated in natural (rather than sexual) selection. The role of sexual selection in ecological speciation is discussed, both in terms of female choice with assortative mating and male-male competition with condition-dependant sexual signals.},

	Abstract = {Experimental infections and field-collected lizards were used to investigate issues of transmission, host specificity, and seasonal occurrence in the nematode Cyrtosomum penneri (Cosmocercoidea: Atractidae). Anolis sagrei (87 males, 42 females) were captured from the Florida Southern College campus, Polk County, Florida, from October 2010 to September 2011, and 8,803 C. penneri were collected from their intestines. During the breeding season all sexually mature (SVL >/= 34 mm) A. sagrei were infected, whereas juvenile lizards (SVL <34 mm) were never infected. Experimental infections, using A. sagrei , found that worms were transferred to new hosts venereally, but not during oral exposures. Mating trials confirmed that worms were consistently transferred between hosts during copulation under natural conditions. Experimental exposures found that land snails and crickets do not serve as transport or intermediate hosts, which supports the idea that C. penneri is transferred only during host copulation. Experimental infections to test host specificity in C. penneri successfully infected A. sagrei , Hemidactylus turcicus , and Sceloporus undulatus , but not Anolis carolinensis or Plestiodon inexpectatus. Overall, this is the first study to fully elucidate the life cycle of any atractid nematode, and we suggest a venereal route of transmission for all atractid worms that infect reptilian hosts. Our findings also have implications for the host's reproductive and behavioral biology, e.g., support for covert or satellite males in the A. sagrei mating system.},

These high heart rates are driven by very similar conduction systems consisting of an atrioventricular node that slows the electrical impulse and a His-Purkinje system that efficiently activates the ventricular chambers. While ectothermic vertebrates have similar contraction patterns, they do not possess anatomical evidence for a conduction system. This lack amongst extant ectotherms is surprising because mammals and birds evolved independently from reptile-like ancestors. Using conserved genetic markers, we found that the conduction system design of lizard (Anolis carolinensis and A. sagrei), frog (Xenopus laevis) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) adults is strikingly similar to that of embryos of mammals (mouse Mus musculus, and man) and chicken (Gallus gallus). Thus, in ectothermic adults, the slow conducting atrioventricular canal muscle is present, no fibrous insulating plane is formed, and the spongy ventricle serves the dual purpose of conduction and contraction. Optical mapping showed base-to-apex activation of the ventricles of the ectothermic animals, similar to the activation pattern of mammalian and avian embryonic ventricles and to the His-Purkinje systems of the formed hearts. Mammalian and avian ventricles uniquely develop thick compact walls and septum and, hence, form a discrete ventricular conduction system from the embryonic spongy ventricle. Our study uncovers the evolutionary building plan of heart and indicates that the building blocks of the conduction system of adult ectothermic vertebrates and embryos of endotherms are similar.},

@article{Kolbe:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Global change is predicted to alter environmental conditions for populations in numerous ways; for example, invasive species often experience substantial shifts in climatic conditions during introduction from their native to non-native ranges. Whether these shifts elicit a phenotypic response, and how adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to phenotypic change, are key issues for understanding biological invasions and how populations may respond to local climate change. We combined modeling, field data, and a laboratory experiment to test for changing thermal tolerances during the introduction of the tropical lizard Anolis cristatellus from Puerto Rico to Miami, Florida. Species distribution models and bioclimatic data analyses showed lower minimum temperatures, and greater seasonal and annual variation in temperature for Miami compared to Puerto Rico. Two separate introductions of A. cristatellus occurred in Miami about 12 km apart, one in South Miami and the other on Key Biscayne, an offshore island. As predicted from the shift in the thermal climate and the thermal tolerances of other Anolis species in Miami, laboratory acclimation and field acclimatization showed that the introduced South Miami population of A. cristatellus has diverged from its native-range source population by acquiring low-temperature acclimation ability. By contrast, the introduced Key Biscayne population showed little change compared to its source. Our analyses predicted an adaptive response for introduced populations, but our comparisons to native-range sources provided evidence for thermal plasticity in one introduced population but not the other. The rapid acquisition of thermal plasticity by A. cristatellus in South Miami may be advantageous for its long-term persistence there and expansion of its non-native range. Our results also suggest that the common assumption of no trait variation when modeling non-native species distributions is invalid.},

@article{Miller:2012aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) is a species of extraordinary zoological interest, being the only surviving member of an entire order of reptiles which diverged early in amniote evolution. In addition to their unique phylogenetic placement, many aspects of tuatara biology, including temperature-dependent sex determination, cold adaptation and extreme longevity have the potential to inform studies of genome evolution and development. Despite increasing interest in the tuatara genome, genomic resources for the species are still very limited. We aimed to address this by assembling a transcriptome for tuatara from an early-stage embryo, which will provide a resource for genome annotation, molecular marker development and studies of development and adaptation in tuatara. RESULTS: We obtained 30 million paired-end 50 bp reads from an Illumina Genome Analyzer and assembled them with Velvet and Oases using a range of kmers. After removing redundancy and filtering out low quality transcripts, our transcriptome dataset contained 32911 transcripts, with an N50 of 675 and a mean length of 451 bp. Almost 50% (15965) of these transcripts could be annotated by comparison with the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein database or the chicken, green anole and zebrafish UniGene sets. A scan of candidate genes and repetitive elements revealed genes involved in immune function, sex differentiation and temperature-sensitivity, as well as over 200 microsatellite markers. CONCLUSIONS: This dataset represents a major increase in genomic resources for the tuatara, increasing the number of annotated gene sequences from just 60 to almost 16,000. This will facilitate future research in sex determination, genome evolution, local adaptation and population genetics of tuatara, as well as inform studies on amniote evolution.},

	Abstract = {Recently, Lee et al. (Lee JH, Silhavy JL, Lee JE, et al. (30 co-authors). 2012. Evolutionarily assembled cis-regulatory module at a human ciliopathy locus. Science (335:966-969.) demonstrated that mutation in either of the transmembrane protein encoding genes, TMEM138 or TMEM216, causes phenotypically indistinguishable ciliopathy. Furthermore, on the basis of the observation that their orthologs are linked in a head-to-tail configuration in other mammals and Anolis, but present on different scaffolds or chromosomes in Xenopus tropicalis and zebrafish, the authors concluded that the two genes were joined by chromosomal rearrangement at the evolutionary amphibian-to-reptile transition to form a functional module. We have sequenced these gene loci in a cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark, and found that the two genes together with a related gene (Tmem80) constitute a tandem cluster. This suggests that the two genes were already linked in the vertebrate ancestor and then rearranged independently in Xenopus and zebrafish. Analyses of the coelacanth and lamprey genomes support this hypothesis. Our study highlights the importance of basal vertebrates as critical reference genomes.},

	Abstract = {This study provides a histological comparison of the mature regenerated and original tail of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. These data will provide a framework for future studies of this emerging model organism whose genome was recently published. This study demonstrated that the cartilage skeleton of the regenerated tail enclosed a spinal cord with an ependymal core, but there was no evidence that dorsal root ganglia or peripheral nerves are regenerated. The cartilage tube contained foramina that allowed the vasculature to cross, but was otherwise a rigid structure. The original tail has muscle groups arranged in quadrants in a regular pattern that attach to the vertebral column. The regenerated tail has irregular muscle bundles of variable number that form unusual attachments to each other and to the cartilage tube. Furthermore, the data show that there was increased connective tissue within the muscle bundles. Implications for functionality of the regenerated tail and for future biomechanical studies are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Polymorphisms provide one of the most useful tools for understanding the maintenance of genetic and phenotypic variation in nature. We have previously described a genetically based polymorphism in dorsal patterning that is expressed by female brown anole lizards, Anolis sagrei, which occur in Bar, Diamond and intermediate Diamond-Bar morphs. Previous studies of island populations in The Bahamas support a role for selection in maintaining the polymorphism, but the agents responsible for this selection remain unclear. We tested two main hypotheses regarding the importance of predation as a selective agent that maintains the polymorphism within populations. First, we tested whether correlational selection favours different combinations of morph, locomotor performance and escape behaviour by measuring morph-specific natural selection on sprint speed, running endurance and the propensity of females to either 'freeze' or 'run' in response to attempted capture. Morphs did not differ in any of these traits, nor did correlational selection consistently favour any particular combinations of morph and antipredator behaviour. Second, we experimentally excluded bird and snake predators from two entire island populations, allowed these predators access to two additional islands and then measured subsequent differences in natural selection on morphs in each population. Predators reduced the survival of Bar and Diamond females, but not of genetically intermediate Diamond-Bar females. These results provide limited evidence that predation may play a role in maintaining this polymorphism, although the functional traits that could account for differential susceptibility to predation remain unclear.},

@article{Powell:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Patterns of brain evolution have been widely studied across vertebrates, with the bulk of studies using mammals and/or birds as model systems. Within these groups, species occupying different habitats have been shown to have divergent neuroanatomy, particularly with regard to differences in the relative size of different brain structures, correlated with differences in habitat complexity. We examined the pattern of allometric scaling across the telencephalon, dorsal cortex, dorsomedial cortex, medial cortex, dorsal ventricular ridge, medulla and cerebellum in six species of Puerto Rican Anolis lizards, which are grouped in three distinct ecomorphs (i.e. ecological types) according to interspecific differences in preferred habitat type. The differences in habitat preferences are accompanied by morphological and behavioral adaptations for effective use of each habitat type. Our results challenge this trend and demonstrate a lack of convergence in the relative size of different brain structures between species belonging to the same ecomorph type. Overall brain volume explained between 92.5 and 99.8% of the variance in the volume of each of the brain regions measured and 93.8 and 98.5% of the variance in the volume of each component measured within the telencephalon. This pattern of brain allometry is consistent with concerted brain evolution. However, in the case of the cerebellum, interspecific differences in volume exhibit a trend in accordance with mosaic brain evolution. This suggests that both concerted and mosaic brain evolution have shaped the anole brain, with the former playing a dominant role. Concerted brain evolution is the primary mechanism shaping the brain in mammals and cartilaginous fishes, and its presence in Anolis lizards provides additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that concerted brain evolution might result from a conserved pattern of brain development common to all vertebrates. More generally, our findings highlight the necessity of further studies of brain evolution in reptiles as they can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying vertebrate brain evolution.},

	Abstract = {Many oceanic islands are notable for their high endemism, suggesting that islands may promote unique assembly processes. However, mainland assemblages sometimes harbour comparable levels of endemism, suggesting that island biotas may not be as unique as is often assumed. Here, we test the uniqueness of island biotic assembly by comparing the rate of species turnover among islands and the mainland, after accounting for distance decay and environmental gradients. We modelled species turnover as a function of geographical and environmental distance for mainland (M-M) communities of Anolis lizards and Terrarana frogs, two clades that have diversified extensively on Caribbean islands and the mainland Neotropics. We compared mainland-island (M-I) and island-island (I-I) species turnover with predictions of the M-M model. If island assembly is not unique, then the M-M model should successfully predict M-I and I-I turnover, given geographical and environmental distance. We found that M-I turnover and, to a lesser extent, I-I turnover were significantly higher than predicted for both clades. Thus, in the first quantitative comparison of mainland-island species turnover, we confirm the long-held but untested assumption that island assemblages accumulate biodiversity differently than their mainland counterparts.},

@article{Bickelmann:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Monotremes are the most basal egg-laying mammals comprised of two extant genera, which are largely nocturnal. Visual pigments, the first step in the sensory transduction cascade in photoreceptors of the eye, have been examined in a variety of vertebrates, but little work has been done to study the rhodopsin of monotremes. We isolated the rhodopsin gene of the nocturnal short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and expressed and functionally characterized the protein in vitro. Three mutants were also expressed and characterized: N83D, an important site for spectral tuning and metarhodopsin kinetics, and two sites with amino acids unique to the echidna (T158A and F169A). The lambda(max) of echidna rhodopsin (497.9 +/- 1.1 nm) did not vary significantly in either T158A (498.0 +/- 1.3 nm) or F169A (499.4 +/- 0.1 nm) but was redshifted in N83D (503.8 +/- 1.5 nm). Unlike other mammalian rhodopsins, echidna rhodopsin did react when exposed to hydroxylamine, although not as fast as cone opsins. The retinal release rate of light-activated echidna rhodopsin, as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy, had a half-life of 9.5 +/- 2.6 min-1, which is significantly shorter than that of bovine rhodopsin. The half-life of the N83D mutant was 5.1 +/- 0.1 min-1, even shorter than wild type. Our results show that with respect to hydroxylamine sensitivity and retinal release, the wild-type echidna rhodopsin displays major differences to all previously characterized mammalian rhodopsins and appears more similar to other nonmammalian vertebrate rhodopsins such as chicken and anole. However, our N83D mutagenesis results suggest that this site may mediate adaptation in the echidna to dim light environments, possibly via increased stability of light-activated intermediates. This study is the first characterization of a rhodopsin from a most basal mammal and indicates that there might be more functional variation in mammalian rhodopsins than previously assumed.},

@article{Ord:2012aa,
	Abstract = {The extent that evolution - including adaptation - is historically contingent (dependent on past events) has often been hotly debated, but is still poorly understood. In particular, there are little data on the degree that behaviour, an aspect of the phenotype that is strongly linked to contemporary environments (social or physical), retains the imprint of evolutionary history. In this study, I examined whether differences in the design of the territorial displays among species of Caribbean Anolis lizards reflect island-specific selection regimes, or historically contingent predispositions associated with different clade histories. Adult males advertise territory ownership using a series of headbobs and dewlap extensions, bouts of which vary in duration among species. When display durations were mapped onto the Anolis phylogeny, prominent differences between species belonging to the Western and Eastern Caribbean radiations were apparent. Statistical analyses confirmed that species differences in the duration of headbob displays, and to some extent the duration of dewlap extensions, were historically contingent. The unique evolutionary histories of each clade have seemingly had a profound effect on the subsequent direction of display evolution among descendent taxa. These results combined with those from previous studies on these lizards show that past history can have an important impact on the type of behaviour exhibited by species today, to the point that adaptive evolution can proceed quite differently in lineages originating from different evolutionary starting points.},

	Abstract = {The process of keratinocyte differentiation was analyzed in the regenerating epidermis of the lizard Anolis carolinensis, where the genes coding for beta-proteins (beta-keratins) are known. The regenerating epidermis forms all epidermal layers found in normal scales (Oberhautchen-, beta-, mesos-, and alpha-layer). Three specific proteins representing the larger families of beta-proteins, glycine-rich (HgG5, 28% glycine, 3.6% cysteine), glycine-cysteine medium-rich (HgGC10, 13% glycine, 14.5% cysteine), and glycine-cysteine rich (HgGC3, 30.4% glycine, 8.7% cysteine) have been immunolocalized at the ultrastructural level. HgG5 is only present in differentiating beta-cells, a weak or no labeling is observed in Oberhautchen and is absent in alpha-cells. The protein is located in the pale corneous material forming the compact beta-layer but is absent in mature Oberhautchen cells. HgGC10 is present among beta-packets in Oberhautchen and beta-cells but disappears in more compact and electron-pale corneous material. The labeling disappears in mesos-cells and is present with variable intensity in alpha-cells, whereas lacunar and clear-cells are low labeled to unlabeled. HgGC3 is sparse or absent in beta-cells but is lightly present in the darker corneous material of differentiating and mature alpha-cells, lacunar-cells, and clear-cells. The study suggests that while glycine-rich proteins (electron-pale) are specifically used for building the resistant and hydrophobic beta-layer, cysteine-glycine rich proteins (electron-denser) are used to form the pliable corneous material present in the Oberhautchen and alpha-cells. The differential accumulation of beta-proteins on the alpha-keratin cytoskeleton scaffold and not the alternance of beta- with alpha-keratins allow the differentiation of different epidermal layers.},

	Abstract = {Recent innovations in next-generation sequencing have lowered the cost of genome projects. Nevertheless, sequencing entire genomes for all representatives in a study remains expensive and unnecessary for most studies in ecology, evolution and conservation. It is still more cost-effective and efficient to target and sequence single-copy nuclear gene markers for such studies. Many tools have been developed for identifying nuclear markers, but most of these have focused on particular taxonomic groups. We have built a searchable database, EvolMarkers, for developing single-copy coding sequence (CDS) and exon-primed-intron-crossing (EPIC) markers that is designed to work across a broad range of phylogenetic divergences. The database is made up of single-copy CDS derived from BLAST searches of a variety of metazoan genomes. Users can search the database for different types of markers (CDS or EPIC) that are common to different sets of input species with different divergence characteristics. EvolMarkers can be applied to any taxonomic group for which genome data are available for two or more species. We included 82 genomes in the first version of EvolMarkers and have found the methods to be effective across Placozoa, Cnidaria, Arthropod, Nematoda, Annelida, Mollusca, Echinodermata, Hemichordata, Chordata and plants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of searching for CDS markers within annelids and show how to find potentially useful intronic markers within the lizard Anolis.},

	Abstract = {Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and TRP vanilloid 1 (V1) perceive noxious temperatures and chemical stimuli and are involved in pain sensation in mammals. Thus, these two channels provide a model for understanding how different genes with similar biological roles may influence the function of one another during the course of evolution. However, the temperature sensitivity of TRPA1 in ancestral vertebrates and its evolutionary path are unknown as its temperature sensitivities vary among different vertebrate species. To elucidate the functional evolution of TRPA1, TRPA1s of the western clawed (WC) frogs and green anole lizards were characterized. WC frog TRPA1 was activated by heat and noxious chemicals that activate mammalian TRPA1. These stimuli also activated native sensory neurons and elicited nocifensive behaviors in WC frogs. Similar to mammals, TRPA1 was functionally co-expressed with TRPV1, another heat- and chemical-sensitive nociceptive receptor, in native sensory neurons of the WC frog. Green anole TRPA1 was also activated by heat and noxious chemical stimulation. These results suggest that TRPA1 was likely a noxious heat and chemical receptor and co-expressed with TRPV1 in the nociceptive sensory neurons of ancestral vertebrates. Conservation of TRPV1 heat sensitivity throughout vertebrate evolution could have changed functional constraints on TRPA1 and influenced the functional evolution of TRPA1 regarding temperature sensitivity, whereas conserving its noxious chemical sensitivity. In addition, our results also demonstrated that two mammalian TRPA1 inhibitors elicited different effect on the TRPA1s of WC frogs and green anoles, which can be utilized to clarify the structural bases for inhibition of TRPA1.},

	Abstract = {This study investigates the gross anatomy of the original and the regenerated tail in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis). Dissections were conducted on 24 original and 13 regenerated tails. While the extrinsic muscles of the original tail in A. carolinensis are similar to those in other known Anolis lizard species, the extent of the origins of m. caudofemoralis longus and m. caudofemoralis brevis is more restricted. These differences may underlie variation in locomotor performance among anole ecomorphs. The intrinsic muscles of the original tail are also described, confirming previous findings and documenting new details, including muscle origins and insertions and the range of intraspecific variation. A comparison of the intrinsic muscles of the original tail and the regenerated tail muscles reveals key differences, such as the lack of interdigitating muscle segments and intramuscular septa in the regenerated tail. These findings, along with the replacement of interlocking vertebrae with a stiff, cartilaginous rod, suggest that important functional differences exist between the original and regenerated tail. In particular, the regenerated tail is predicted to be less capable of coordinated, fine movements. Studies of the physical properties and range of motion of the original and regenerated tail are required to test this hypothesis. This atlas of tail anatomy in A. carolinensis represents a key resource for developmental and genetic studies of tail regeneration in lizards, as well as studies of anole evolution and biomechanics.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Repeated adaptive radiations are evident when phenotypic divergence occurs within lineages, but this divergence into different forms is convergent when compared across lineages. Classic examples of such repeated adaptive divergence occur in island (for example, Caribbean Anolis lizards) and lake systems (for example, African cichlids). Host-parasite systems in many respects are analogous to island systems, where host species represent isolated islands for parasites whose life cycle is highly tied to that of their hosts. Thus, host-parasite systems might exhibit interesting cases of repeated adaptive divergence as seen in island and lake systems.The feather lice of birds spend their entire life cycle on the body of the host and occupy distinct microhabitats on the host: head, wing, body and generalist. These microhabitat specialists show pronounced morphological differences corresponding to how they escape from host preening. We tested whether these different microhabitat specialists were a case of repeated adaptive divergence by constructing both morphological and molecular phylogenies for a diversity of avian feather lice, including many examples of head, wing, body and generalist forms. RESULTS: Morphological and molecular based phylogenies were highly incongruent, which could be explained by rampant convergence in morphology related to microhabitat specialization on the host. In many cases lice from different microhabitat specializations, but from the same group of birds, were sister taxa. CONCLUSIONS: This pattern indicates a process of repeated adaptive divergence of these parasites within host group, but convergence when comparing parasites across host groups. These results suggest that host-parasite systems might be another case in which repeated adaptive radiations could be relatively common, but potentially overlooked, because morphological convergence can obscure evolutionary relationships.},

	Abstract = {The epidermis of different scales in the lizard Anolis carolinensis expresses specific keratin-associated beta-proteins (beta-keratins). In order to localize the sites of accumulation of different beta-proteins, we have utilized antibodies directed against representative members of the main families of beta-proteins, the glycine-rich (HgG5), glycine-cysteine rich (HgGC3), glycine-cysteine medium-rich (HgGC10), and cysteine-rich (HgC1) beta-proteins. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemical controls confirm the specificity of the antibodies made against these proteins. Light and ultrastructural immunocytochemistry shows that the glycine-rich protein HgG5 is present in beta-layers of different body scales but is scarce in the oberhautchen and claws, and is absent in alpha-layers and adhesive setae. The cysteine-glycine-rich protein HgGC3 is low to absent in the oberhautchen, beta-layer, and mesos-layer but increases in alpha-layers. This beta-protein is low in claws where it is likely associated with the hard alpha-keratins previously studied in this lizard. The glycine-cysteine medium-rich HgGC10 protein is low in the beta-layer, higher in alpha-layers, and in the oberhautchen. This protein forms a major component of setal proteins including those of the adhesive spatula that allow this lizard to stick on vertical surfaces. HgC1 is poorly localized in most epidermis analyzed including adhesive setae and claws and appears as a minor component of the alpha-layers. In conclusion, the present study suggests that beta- and alpha-layers of lizard epidermis represent regions with different accumulation of glycine-rich proteins (mainly for mechanical resistance and hydrophobicity in the beta-layer) or cysteine-glycine-rich proteins (for both resistance and elasticity in both alpha- and beta-layers).},

	Abstract = {The green anole (Anolis carolinensis) has been widely used as an animal model in physiology and neurobiology but has recently emerged as an important genomic model. The recent sequencing of its genome has shed new light on the evolution of vertebrate genomes and on the process that govern species diversification. Surprisingly, the patterns of genetic diversity within natural populations of this widespread and abundant North American lizard remain relatively unknown. In the present study, we use 10 novel nuclear DNA sequence loci (N = 62 to 152) and one mitochondrial locus (N = 226) to delimit green anole populations and infer their historical demography. We uncovered four evolutionarily distinct and geographically restricted lineages of green anoles using phylogenetics, bayesian clustering, and genetic distance methods. Molecular dating indicates that these lineages last shared a common ancestor approximately 2 million years ago. Summary statistics and analysis of the frequency distributions of DNA polymorphisms strongly suggest range-wide expansions in population size. Using Bayesian Skyline Plots, we inferred the timing of population size expansions, which differ across lineages, and found evidence for a relatively recent and rapid westward expansion of green anoles across the Gulf Coastal Plain during the mid-Pleistocene. One surprising result is that the distribution of genetic diversity is not consistent with a latitudinal shift caused by climatic oscillations as is observed for many co-distributed taxa. This suggests that the most recent Pleistocene glacial cycles had a limited impact on the geographic distribution of the green anole at the northern limits of its range.},

	Abstract = {The range of inclines and perch diameters in arboreal habitats poses a number of functional challenges for locomotion. To effectively overcome these challenges, arboreal lizards execute complex locomotor behaviors involving both the forelimbs and the hindlimbs. However, few studies have examined the role of forelimbs in lizard locomotion. To characterize how the forelimbs and hindlimbs differentially respond to changes in substrate diameter and incline, we obtained three-dimensional high-speed video of green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) running on flat (9 cm wide) and narrow (1.3 cm) perches inclined at 0, 45 and 90 deg. Changes in perch diameter had a greater effect on kinematics than changes in incline, and proximal limb variables were primarily responsible for these kinematic changes. In addition, a number of joint angles exhibited greater excursions on the 45 deg incline compared with the other inclines. Anolis carolinensis adopted strategies to maintain stability similar to those of other arboreal vertebrates, increasing limb flexion, stride frequency and duty factor. However, the humerus and femur exhibited several opposite kinematic trends with changes in perch diameter. Further, the humerus exhibited a greater range of motion than the femur. A combination of anatomy and behavior resulted in differential kinematics between the forelimb and the hindlimb, and also a potential shift in the propulsive mechanism with changes in external demand. This suggests that a better understanding of single limb function comes from an assessment of both forelimbs and hindlimbs. Characterizing forelimb and hindlimb movements may reveal interesting functional differences between Anolis ecomorphs. Investigations into the physiological mechanisms underlying the functional differences between the forelimb and the hindlimb are needed to fully understand how arboreal animals move in complex habitats.},

	Abstract = {Natural branches vary conspicuously in their diameter, density and orientation, but how these latter two factors affect animal locomotion is poorly understood. Thus, for three species of arboreal anole lizards found on different size branches and with different limb lengths, we tested sprinting performance on cylinders with five diameters (5-100 mm) and five patterns of pegs, which simulated different branch orientations and spacing. We also tested whether the lizards preferred surfaces that enhanced their performance. The overall responses to different surfaces were similar among the three species, although the magnitude of the effects differed. All species were faster on cylinders with larger diameter and no pegs along the top. The short-limbed species was the slowest on all surfaces. Much of the variation in performance resulted from variable amounts of pausing among different surfaces and species. Lizards preferred to run along the top of cylinders, but pegs along the top of the narrow cylinders interfered with this. Pegs on top of the 100-mm diameter cylinder, however, had little effect on speed as the lizards ran quite a straight path alongside pegs without bumping into them. All three species usually chose surfaces with greater diameters and fewer pegs, but very large diameters with pegs were preferred to much smaller diameter cylinders without pegs. Our results suggest that preferring larger diameters in natural vegetation has a direct benefit for speed and an added benefit of allowing detouring around branches with little adverse effect on speed.},
